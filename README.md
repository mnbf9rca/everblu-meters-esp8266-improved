Read Itron/Actaris EverBlu Cyble Enhanced RF water and gas meters (RADIAN protocol, Sontex/Itron) on 433 MHz using an ESP8266 or ESP32 and a CC1101 transceiver, then publish readings to Home Assistant.

Two independent deployment targets share the same core radio/protocol logic:

- **ESPHome external component** (recommended): native Home Assistant integration, no MQTT broker.
- **Standalone firmware with MQTT**: PlatformIO/Arduino build with MQTT AutoDiscovery.

**Supports both water meters (readings in litres) and gas meters (readings in cubic metres)**.

> [!NOTE]
> **This project runs on both ESP8266 and ESP32.** Despite the `esp8266` in the repository name (kept for historical continuity), the firmware fully supports ESP32 and ESP32-C3 as well. Both deployment targets, the standalone MQTT firmware and the ESPHome component, are built and CI-tested on ESP8266 **and** ESP32 (see the ESP32 Build badge above). Ready-to-use PlatformIO environments ship for both families: `huzzah`, `d1_mini`, `d1_mini_pro`, `nodemcuv2` (ESP8266) and `esp32dev`, `esp32-c3-ard` (ESP32/ESP32-C3). There is also a [Nano ESP32 ESPHome example](ESPHOME/example-nano-esp32.yaml).

### **ESPHome** - Release V3.0.0

The ESPHome integration is stable and is the recommended way to get started. It ships as a versioned external component in `ESPHOME-release` that tracks the same code as the main firmware, and it is tested on both ESP8266 and ESP32 with water and gas meters (the same sensors and calibration logic apply). Configuration stays simple: drop in the component, set `meter_code`, `meter_type` and `gdo2_pin`, and you are done.

Start here:

- **[ESPHOME/README.md](ESPHOME/README.md)** - ESPHome setup, wiring and configuration reference
- **[ESPHOME/docs/ESPHOME_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md](ESPHOME/docs/ESPHOME_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md)** - complete step-by-step installation guide
- Ready-made configs: [water](ESPHOME/example-water-meter.yaml) · [gas](ESPHOME/example-gas-meter-minimal.yaml) · [advanced](ESPHOME/example-advanced.yaml) · [multi-meter](ESPHOME/example-multi-meter.yaml) · [Nano ESP32](ESPHOME/example-nano-esp32.yaml)

A couple of things to know before you flash:

- Requires **ESPHome 2026.1.0 or later**. Config validation enforces this, so an older install fails during validation with a clear message.
- Build with the Arduino framework (set `esp32.framework.type: arduino`); ESP-IDF is not supported for this component.
- Migrating from the MQTT firmware? Keep the same meter serial values so your topics and entities stay aligned.

> [!WARNING]
> **Breaking change in v3.0.0:** GDO2 hardware FIFO management is now enabled by default. You must wire CC1101 GDO2 and set `gdo2_pin:` (or opt out with `disable_gdo2_fifo_management: true`). See the [Hardware](#hardware) section and [ESPHOME/README.md](ESPHOME/README.md).

---

The firmware is developed and tested against the [Itron EverBlu Cyble Enhanced](https://multipartirtaanugra.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/09.-Cyble-RF.pdf). Based on the regulatory paperwork for this meter family, it is likely to work with these related models too, although they are untested:

- AnyQuest Cyble Enhanced
- EverBlu Cyble
- AnyQuest Cyble Basic

## Features

A quick overview of what the firmware does:

- Reads water or gas usage from Itron EverBlu Cyble Enhanced RF meters over 433 MHz.
- Integrates with Home Assistant through MQTT AutoDiscovery **or** the native ESPHome component (same core code).
- Runs daily scheduled readings on the days you choose.
- Validates every frame with CRC-16/KERMIT and reports signal diagnostics (RSSI/LQI).
- Calibrates the CC1101 frequency automatically, including a wide scan on first boot.
- Manages the CC1101 FIFO in hardware via GDO2, **enabled by default (v3.0.0+)** for more reliable TX/RX (opt out to use legacy SPI polling). See [Hardware](#hardware).

### Full feature list

- **Meter data**: fetches usage from Itron EverBlu Cyble Enhanced RF meters, in litres (L, water device class) or cubic metres (m³, gas device class).
- **Extra meter fields**: decodes the meter's own real-time clock and its type/identifier string, alongside the read counter, battery months and up to 13 monthly historical volumes.
- **Diagnostics**: exposes RSSI (raw, dBm and %), LQI and signal strength, plus Time Start and Time End sensors that show when the meter wakes and sleeps.
- **Home Assistant**: MQTT AutoDiscovery for the standalone firmware, or a native ESPHome component for direct integration.
- **Frequency handling**: automatic CC1101 calibration, with a manual fallback.
- **Hardware FIFO management (GDO2, enabled by default in v3.0.0+)**: per-phase reconfiguration prevents TX FIFO underflows and skips unnecessary RX SPI reads. Wire GDO2 to a free GPIO, or opt out to keep legacy SPI polling. See [Hardware](#hardware) for wiring and the opt-out.
- **Frame integrity**: every frame is verified end-to-end with CRC-16/KERMIT (computed over the full 124-byte frame, including the length byte, with the trailer in the last two bytes) and corrupted RADIAN frames are discarded before any data is published.
- **Scheduling**: daily readings, with days set by preset (Monday-Friday, Monday-Saturday, Monday-Sunday) or a single named day.
- **Connectivity**: Wi-Fi diagnostics and OTA updates.

### Advanced Frame Validation

<details>
<summary>How the firmware validates every frame (6 layers)</summary>

The firmware implements multiple layers of validation to ensure data integrity:

1. **Custom Serial Decoding**: RADIAN protocol uses a proprietary serial encoding with 1 start bit + 8 data bits (LSB first) + 3 stop bits per byte. Each bit is oversampled 4x for noise immunity (logical '1' = 0xF0, logical '0' = 0x0F). The decoder verifies bit-level transitions, counts consecutive samples, validates start/stop bits, and extracts clean data bytes. This is custom serial framing, not standard Manchester encoding, and it must be decoded in software.

2. **CRC-16/KERMIT Checksum**: Each RADIAN frame includes a 16-bit checksum (polynomial 0x8408, init 0x0000). Technically this is a Frame Check Sequence (FCS), not a true CRC, but it's highly effective at catching transmission errors and corrupted frames. The checksum is computed over the full 124-byte frame (bytes [0..121], including the length byte) and compared against the trailer in the last two bytes [122-123]. The firmware rejects any frame that fails this check.

3. **Frame Structure Validation**:
   - Preamble pattern matching (0xAAAAAAAA sync word)
   - Fixed-length frame verification (58 bytes expected)
   - Header field sanity checks (protocol version, frame type)
   - Meter serial number matching (only accepts frames from your configured meter)

4. **Temporal Validation**:
   - Wake window verification (Time Start/End must be valid 24-hour format)
   - Reading counter continuity checks (detects duplicate or out-of-sequence frames)
   - Battery level sanity bounds (0-200 months typical range)

5. **Signal Quality Filtering**:
   - RSSI threshold (configurable, default -90 dBm)
   - LQI (Link Quality Indicator) assessment
   - Frequency error estimation for adaptive tuning

6. **Reading Plausibility (History Cross-Check)**:
   - The frame carries up to 13 months of historical volume snapshots. The firmware rejects the whole reading when the implied **current-month usage** (current volume minus the newest history snapshot) exceeds **100× the largest historical monthly usage**. A corrupted current volume shows up as an absurd jump versus the meter's own history.
   - The check is skipped (the reading is accepted) when there is insufficient history to judge: fewer than 2 valid months, a flat history with no recorded usage, or a current volume that predates the newest snapshot. First reads and no-consumption meters are therefore unaffected.

**Result**: Data is only published after passing every check above, so corrupted or partial frames are discarded rather than reported to Home Assistant.

## Integration Options

You can integrate with Home Assistant in one of two ways. Both share the **same core codebase**: the CC1101 radio handling, RADIAN protocol decoding, frequency calibration and frame validation are identical, so choose whichever suits your setup.

### Option 1: ESPHome Component (Recommended)

**Best for**: Users who prefer ESPHome's YAML configuration and native Home Assistant integration.

- Simple YAML configuration
- Native Home Assistant integration
- Automatic sensor discovery
- All ESPHome features (OTA, logging, etc.)
- No MQTT broker required

Examples: use the ready-made ESPHome configs:

- [ESPHOME/example-water-meter.yaml](ESPHOME/example-water-meter.yaml)
- [ESPHOME/example-gas-meter-minimal.yaml](ESPHOME/example-gas-meter-minimal.yaml)
- [ESPHOME/example-advanced.yaml](ESPHOME/example-advanced.yaml)
- [ESPHOME/example-multi-meter.yaml](ESPHOME/example-multi-meter.yaml)
- [ESPHOME/example-nano-esp32.yaml](ESPHOME/example-nano-esp32.yaml)

**Full documentation**: [ESPHOME/docs/ESPHOME_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md](ESPHOME/docs/ESPHOME_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md)

### Option 2: Standalone with MQTT

<details>
<summary>Expand: standalone MQTT setup and first-reading quick start</summary>

**Best for**: Users who want direct control, custom builds, or already use MQTT extensively.

- Full control over firmware
- PlatformIO-based development
- MQTT AutoDiscovery for Home Assistant
- Extensive customisation options

**Quick start**: Edit `include/private.h` and build with PlatformIO (see below).

### Quick Start: First Successful Reading

#### 1. Hardware you need

- ESP8266 (HUZZAH / Wemos D1 Mini) or ESP32 DevKit.
- CC1101 433 MHz RF module (3.3V only).
- USB cable and jumper wires.

See the Hardware section below for full wiring tables and pictures.

#### 2. Files you must edit

- `include/private.h` (copy from `include/private.example.h`):
  - Wi‑Fi SSID/password
  - MQTT broker/port (+ credentials, if used)
  - `ENABLE_HA_DISCOVERY` - set to `0` to disable Home Assistant discovery topic publishing (`homeassistant/...`) and keep raw MQTT topics only
  - `METER_CODE` (full under-barcode code with dashes)
  - `METER_TYPE` - set to `"water"` (default) or `"gas"` depending on your meter type
  - `GDO2` - **required by default (v3.0.0+)**: GPIO connected to CC1101 GDO2 (hardware FIFO management). To opt out and use legacy SPI polling, define `DISABLE_GDO2_FIFO_MANAGEMENT` instead. The firmware will not compile until you do one or the other.
  - `MAX_RETRIES` - maximum reading retry attempts before cooldown (optional, default is 5)
  - `AUTO_SCAN_ON_FAILURE_ENABLED` - set to `1` to automatically run a frequency scan once after `MAX_RETRIES` is reached (recovers from carrier-frequency drift unattended); default is `0` (disabled)
  - `ADAPTIVE_THRESHOLD` - how many successful reads before adjusting frequency (optional, default is 1 = adjust after each read)
  - `WIFI_SERIAL_MONITOR_ENABLED` - set to `1` to enable WiFi serial monitor for remote debugging (default is `0` for security)
- `platformio.ini`: select `env:huzzah` (ESP8266 HUZZAH) or `env:esp32dev` (ESP32 DevKit).

#### Meter Type Configuration

This project supports both **water meters** and **gas meters**. The main differences are:

| Meter Type          | Unit of Measurement | Device Class | Icon            |
| ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------ | --------------- |
| **Water** (default) | Litres (L)          | `water`      | `mdi:water`     |
| **Gas**             | Cubic metres (m³)   | `gas`        | `mdi:meter-gas` |

To configure your meter type, set `METER_TYPE` in `include/private.h`:

```cpp
#define METER_TYPE "water"  // For water meters
// OR
#define METER_TYPE "gas"    // For gas meters
```

##### Gas Meter Volume Divisor

For gas meters, this firmware assumes an internal count in litre-equivalents and converts those values to cubic metres (m³) before publishing to Home Assistant. If your gas meter uses a different base unit or scaling, you may need to adjust the meter configuration or conversion logic accordingly.

The conversion uses a configurable **gas volume divisor** that can be set in `include/private.h`:

```cpp
// Default: 100 (equivalent to 0.01 m³ per unit)
#define GAS_VOLUME_DIVISOR 100
```

**Important:** The correct divisor depends on your meter's pulse weight configuration:

- `100`: 0.01 m³ per unit (typical for modern EverBlu Cyble gas modules)
- `1000`: 0.001 m³ per unit (0.1 L per unit, less common)

###### How We Determined the Correct Divisor

<details>
<summary>Background: empirical derivation of the 0.01 m³/unit pulse weight</summary>

Through empirical testing with an actual EverBlu Cyble gas meter, we discovered that many gas modules are configured with a pulse weight of **0.01 m³ per unit**, not the 0.001 m³ that might be expected from a naive "litres to cubic metres" conversion.

**Real-world example:**

- Physical meter register: 825,292 m³
- RADIAN protocol data (raw value): 0x00013E07 = 81,415 units
- Using divisor 1000: 81.415 m³ (incorrect, off by ~744 m³)
- Using divisor 100: 814.15 m³ (correct, ~11 m³ gap from register)

The gap of ~11 m³ is consistent with the assumption that the EverBlu module was installed after the meter had already recorded some consumption. Without access to the meter's installation records or multiple data points, we cannot definitively confirm the exact pulse weight; however, **0.01 m³/unit proved more plausible through trial and error comparison with the actual mechanical meter register**.

</details>

**If your readings seem incorrect:** Verify your specific meter's pulse weight (often printed on the device label) and adjust `GAS_VOLUME_DIVISOR` accordingly.

#### 3. Build and upload the firmware

##### First-time USB Upload

1. Wire the CC1101 to your board as shown in the Hardware section.
2. Connect the board to your computer via USB.
3. Open the project folder in VS Code with PlatformIO installed.
4. **Select your board environment** using the PlatformIO status bar at the bottom:
   - For **Adafruit HUZZAH ESP8266**: select `env:huzzah`
   - For **WeMos D1 Mini**: select `env:d1_mini`
   - For **WeMos D1 Mini Pro**: select `env:d1_mini_pro`
   - For **NodeMCU v2**: select `env:nodemcuv2`
   - For **ESP32 DevKit**: select `env:esp32dev`
5. Click the **PlatformIO: Upload and Monitor** button (→ with line) in the status bar, or use the PlatformIO sidebar:
   - Click the PlatformIO icon on the left sidebar
   - Expand your environment (e.g., "huzzah")
   - Click "Upload and Monitor"
6. Wait for the build and upload to complete.
7. On first boot, wait up to ~2 minutes while the automatic wide frequency scan runs (serial monitor will show progress).
8. Once the scan finishes, you should see meter data in the serial monitor and MQTT topics `everblu/cyble/{PARSED_SERIAL}/...` on your broker/Home Assistant.

##### Over-The-Air (OTA) Updates

Once your device is running and connected to Wi-Fi, you can update it wirelessly:

1. In `platformio.ini`, find your board's `-ota` environment (e.g., `[env:huzzah-ota]`).
2. **Update the IP address** to match your device's IP:

   ```ini
   upload_port = 192.168.2.21  ; Change to your device's IP
   monitor_port = socket://192.168.2.21:23  ; Change to match upload_port
   ```

3. **Select the OTA environment** in PlatformIO:
   - For **HUZZAH**: select `env:huzzah-ota`
   - For **D1 Mini**: select `env:d1_mini-ota`
   - For **D1 Mini Pro**: select `env:d1_mini_pro-ota`
   - For **NodeMCU v2**: select `env:nodemcuv2-ota`
   - For **ESP32 DevKit**: select `env:esp32dev-ota`
4. Click **PlatformIO: Upload and Monitor** as before.
5. The firmware will be uploaded over your Wi-Fi network.

> **Note**: You can find your device's IP address in the serial monitor output at startup, or check your router's DHCP client list, or look at the `everblu/cyble/{PARSED_SERIAL}/wifi_ip` MQTT topic in Home Assistant.

</details>

## Hardware

The firmware runs on any ESP8266 or ESP32 paired with a CC1101 433 MHz transceiver. Any such combination works, as long as the wiring is correct.
![ESP8266 with CC1101](docs/images/board2.jpg)
![ESP8266 with CC1101](docs/images/board.jpg)

### Connections (ESP32/ESP8266 to CC1101)

The project talks to the CC1101 over the ESP8266/ESP32 **hardware SPI pins**. The wiring diagrams below cover the common ESP8266 boards and the ESP32 DevKit.

#### Pin Mapping Reference

**For ESP8266 (All Boards):**

- **SCK (SPI Clock)**: GPIO 14
- **MISO (Master In Slave Out)**: GPIO 12
- **MOSI (Master Out Slave In)**: GPIO 13
- **CS/SS (Chip Select)**: GPIO 15
- **GDO0 (CC1101 Data Ready)**: GPIO 5 (configurable in `private.h`)
- **GDO2 (CC1101 FIFO Threshold)**: **Required by default (v3.0.0+)**, any free GPIO (e.g. GPIO 4 / D2). Opt out with `DISABLE_GDO2_FIFO_MANAGEMENT` to fall back to SPI polling.

#### Important Notes

- **Voltage:** The CC1101 operates at **3.3V only**. Do not connect to 5V or you will damage the module.
- **Hardware SPI:** This project uses the ESP8266/ESP32's hardware SPI interface for reliable, high-speed communication.
- **GDO0 Pin:** Default is GPIO 5 for ESP8266, GPIO 4 for ESP32. You can change this in your `private.h` file if needed.
- **GDO2 Pin (required by default, v3.0.0+):** **Breaking change** - the CC1101 GDO2 pin now drives hardware-assisted FIFO threshold management by default. You must wire CC1101 GDO2 to a free MCU GPIO and configure it via `#define GDO2 <pin>` in `private.h` (MQTT firmware) or `gdo2_pin` in YAML (ESPHome). The driver dynamically reconfigures GDO2 per phase: TX (prevents `TXFIFO_UNDERFLOW`) and RX (skips unnecessary SPI reads and improves scheduler efficiency). To keep the legacy SPI-polling behaviour instead, explicitly opt out: define `DISABLE_GDO2_FIFO_MANAGEMENT` in `private.h`, or set `disable_gdo2_fifo_management: true` in ESPHome. The MQTT firmware will not compile, and the ESPHome config will not validate, until you either wire/configure GDO2 or opt out. Use any free GPIO that does not collide with the SPI bus or GDO0. See [docs/GDO2_FIFO_MANAGEMENT.md](docs/GDO2_FIFO_MANAGEMENT.md).
- **Distance & Signal Quality:** The RADIAN protocol implementation does not have publicly available CRC checksums for the manufacturer's proprietary encoding, making readings somewhat vulnerable to RF interference. Weak signal (distance > 10+ meters) or electrical interference can cause read failures. **Keep the CC1101 radio within a few meters (~2-5m ideally) of your meter for reliable communication.** If you experience frequent "No ACK frame received" or "No data frame received" failures, try moving the radio closer to the meter to rule out signal strength issues before investigating hardware wiring.

#### Regulatory Notes

The EU declaration of conformity for the Cyble RF family (Cyble NRF, Cyble NRF HT, Cyble OMS wM-Bus 434) specifies operation in the 434 MHz ISM band with ≤ 10 mW radiated power.
The CC1101 settings used in this project stay within that envelope, but ensure your antenna choice and deployment follow local regulations.

GDO2   → GPIO 27 (or another free GPIO)  ← required by default, set #define GDO2 in private.h (or opt out)
```

Notes for ESP32

- Use the board’s hardware SPI pins (SCK/MISO/MOSI).
The defaults are provided by the Arduino core and used automatically by this project.
- For chip-select (CSN/CS), prefer a non-strapping GPIO such as GPIO 25. The common default `SS` (GPIO 5) is a strapping pin and logs a boot-time warning, though it still works.
- Choose a free GPIO for GDO0 (e.g., 4 or 27) and set `#define GDO0 <pin>` in `include/private.h`.
- Wire GDO2 to another free GPIO and set `#define GDO2 <pin>` to enable hardware FIFO threshold management (required by default since v3.0.0); to keep legacy SPI polling instead, define `DISABLE_GDO2_FIFO_MANAGEMENT`.
- Power the CC1101 from 3.3V only.

#### Adafruit Feather HUZZAH Silkscreen Labels

To make wiring dead-simple on the HUZZAH, here’s the exact silkscreen text next to each pin we use and what it connects to on the CC1101:

- Power
  - Board label: "3V" → CC1101 VCC (3.3V only)
  - Board label: "GND" → CC1101 GND

- SPI signals
  - Board label: "SCK / #14" → CC1101 SCK (SPI Clock)
  - Board label: "MISO / #12" → CC1101 MISO
  - Board label: "MOSI / #13" → CC1101 MOSI
  - Board label: "SS / #15"   → CC1101 CSN (Chip Select)

- CC1101 interrupt (data ready)
  - Board label: "#5" → CC1101 GDO0  (default; configurable via `private.h`)

Notes

- On the HUZZAH, many pins show both the function and the GPIO number, e.g. "SCK / #14".
You can use either reference when wiring.
- Only use the 3V (3.3V) pin to power the CC1101. Do not use 5V.

#### HUZZAH Boot-Strap Pins and Red LED (GPIO #0)

On the Adafruit Feather HUZZAH ESP8266, **GPIO #0 has a red LED attached and is also a boot-strap pin** used to enter the ROM bootloader.
Important implications:

- If GPIO #0 is held LOW during reset/power-up, the ESP8266 will enter the bootloader instead of running your sketch.
- The red LED on GPIO #0 is wired “reverse”: writing LOW turns the LED ON, writing HIGH turns it OFF.
- GPIO #0 does not have an internal pull-up by default.

Because of the above, **do not use GPIO #0 for CC1101 GDO0**.
This project defaults to using **GPIO #5** for GDO0 on HUZZAH, which is safe and avoids accidental bootloader entry.
You can still use GPIO #0 for simple LED indication in your own code, but avoid wiring CC1101 signals to it.

Also note other ESP8266 boot-strap pins on HUZZAH:

- GPIO #15 (used here as CS/SS) must be LOW at boot (the HUZZAH board provides the correct pull-down).
Don’t force it HIGH during reset.
- GPIO #2 should normally be HIGH at boot (not used by this project).

## MQTT Integration

In standalone mode, the firmware integrates with Home Assistant through MQTT AutoDiscovery, so entities appear automatically once the device connects to your broker.

<details>
<summary>MQTT topics</summary>

The following MQTT topics are used to integrate the device with Home Assistant via AutoDiscovery. Every topic sits under `everblu/cyble/<serial>/`, where `<serial>` is the serial number parsed from `METER_CODE`, so several devices can share one broker.

**Meter readings**

| **Sensor**   | **Topic suffix**  | **Description**                                             |
| ------------ | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Liters`     | `liters`          | Total usage in litres, or m³ for a gas meter.               |
| `Battery`    | `battery`         | Remaining battery life in months.                           |
| `Counter`    | `counter`         | Times the meter has been read (wraps around 255→1).         |
| `RSSI (dBm)` | `rssi_dbm`        | Signal strength of the meter's reply, in dBm.               |
| `RSSI (%)`   | `rssi_percentage` | The same value as a percentage. See the note below.         |
| `LQI`        | `lqi`             | Raw link quality indicator (0-127, lower is better).        |
| `LQI (%)`    | `lqi_percentage`  | Link quality inverted so that higher is better.             |
| `Time Start` | `time_start`      | Time when the meter wakes up, formatted as `HH:MM`.         |
| `Time End`   | `time_end`        | Time when the meter goes to sleep, formatted as `HH:MM`.    |
| `Timestamp`  | `timestamp`       | ISO 8601 timestamp of the last reading.                     |
| `Meter Time` | `meter_time`      | The meter's own real-time clock, decoded from the frame.    |
| `Meter Type` | `meter_type`      | The meter's type/identifier string, decoded from the frame. |

Two further topics carry no entity of their own: `liters_attributes` holds the past-months history that Home Assistant attaches to `Liters`, and `json` carries the whole reading as one document for templating.

**Device and radio diagnostics**

| **Sensor**           | **Topic suffix**          | **Description**                                             |
| -------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Radio State`        | `cc1101_state`            | `Idle`, `Reading`, `Frequency Scanning` or `unavailable`.   |
| `Active Reading`     | `active_reading`          | `true` while a read is in progress.                         |
| `Status`             | `status_message`          | Human-readable description of what the device is doing.     |
| `Last Error`         | `last_error`              | Why the last read failed, or `None`.                        |
| `Total Attempts`     | `total_attempts`          | Read attempts since boot.                                   |
| `Successful Reads`   | `successful_reads`        | Successful reads since boot.                                |
| `Failed Reads`       | `failed_reads`            | Reads that exhausted every retry.                           |
| `Frequency Offset`   | `frequency_offset`        | Stored calibration offset, in kHz.                          |
| `Tuned Frequency`    | `tuned_frequency`         | Frequency the radio is actually tuned to, in MHz.           |
| `Frequency Estimate` | `frequency_estimate`      | CC1101 FREQEST reading from the last frame, in kHz.         |
| `Diagnostic Report`  | `diagnostic_report_state` | Last diagnostic report. See the command topics below.       |
| `Meter Year`         | `everblu_meter_year`      | Production year parsed from `METER_CODE`.                   |
| `Meter Serial`       | `everblu_meter_serial`    | Serial number parsed from `METER_CODE`.                     |
| `Reading Schedule`   | `reading_schedule`        | Configured schedule, for example `Monday-Friday`.           |
| `Reading Time (UTC)` | `reading_time`            | Resolved daily read time in UTC, which may be auto-aligned. |

The device also publishes `status` (the availability / last-will topic, `online` or `offline`) and `cc1101_availability`, which is what enables or disables the buttons when the radio does not come up.

**Device and network**

| **Sensor**         | **Topic suffix**         | **Description**                         |
| ------------------ | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| `Wi-Fi IP`         | `wifi_ip`                | IP address of the device.               |
| `Wi-Fi RSSI`       | `wifi_rssi`              | Wi-Fi signal strength in dBm.           |
| `Wi-Fi Signal (%)` | `wifi_signal_percentage` | Wi-Fi signal strength as a percentage.  |
| `MAC Address`      | `mac_address`            | MAC address of the device.              |
| `SSID`             | `wifi_ssid`              | Wi-Fi SSID the device is connected to.  |
| `BSSID`            | `wifi_bssid`             | Wi-Fi BSSID the device is connected to. |
| `Uptime`           | `uptime`                 | Device uptime in ISO 8601 format.       |

> **Note on `RSSI (%)`.** The percentage is a display convenience, not a calibrated measurement. It maps the -120 to -40 dBm range onto 0-100% so Home Assistant can show a signal bar; the endpoints were chosen to span roughly "unusable" to "right next to the meter" and have no physical meaning. Judge link quality from the dBm and LQI values instead. The same scale is used by the ESPHome `rssi_percentage` sensor and by the device log.

</details>

<details>
<summary>MQTT command topics (Home Assistant buttons)</summary>

Each of these appears in Home Assistant as a button on the device. `<serial>` is the meter serial number parsed from `METER_CODE`.

| **Button**               | **MQTT Topic**                             | **Payload** | **Description**                                                   |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Request Reading Now`    | `everblu/cyble/<serial>/trigger_force`     | `update`    | Read the meter immediately, bypassing the cooldown.               |
| `Frequency Scan`         | `everblu/cyble/<serial>/scan`              | `scan`      | Search near saved tuning, then widen if empty. |
| `Deep Frequency Scan`    | `everblu/cyble/<serial>/deep_scan`         | `scan`      | Coarse/fine acquisition across ±150 kHz, then refine and verify. |
| `Stop Frequency Scan`    | `everblu/cyble/<serial>/stop_scan`         | `stop`      | Cancel between transactions and restore previous tuning. |
| `Reset Frequency Offset` | `everblu/cyble/<serial>/reset_frequency`   | `reset`     | Clear the stored calibration and re-tune from the base frequency. |
| `Diagnostic Report`      | `everblu/cyble/<serial>/diagnostic_report` | `report`    | Log and publish the wiring / SPI link / radio report. See below.  |
| `Restart Device`         | `everblu/cyble/<serial>/restart`           | `restart`   | Reboot the ESP.                                                   |

There is also a `everblu/cyble/<serial>/trigger` topic, which is the same as `trigger_force` except that it respects the retry cooldown.

**Diagnostic Report** prints one copy-pasteable block covering the configured CS/GDO0/GDO2 pins, a live SPI link self-test, the key CC1101 registers (PARTNUM, VERSION, MARCSTATE, FREQ2/1/0, MDMCFG4/3/2, PKTCTRL0), RSSI/LQI, the GDO0 wiring self-test verdict and the current GDO0/GDO2 line levels. Press it first when raising an issue: it tells a wiring fault apart from an RF problem in one step, and it works even when the radio never came up.

The report goes to the log (serial monitor at 115200 baud, or the [WiFi serial monitor](docs/WIFI_SERIAL_MONITOR.md)) and is also published retained to `everblu/cyble/<serial>/diagnostic_report_state`, so you can read it from Home Assistant without a serial cable. A Home Assistant state is capped at 255 characters, so the `Diagnostic Report` sensor shows when the report was taken and the text is held in its `report` attribute: open **Developer tools -> States**, select the entity, and copy the attribute. Because the topic is retained, the report is still there after a Home Assistant restart.

The ESPHome component has the same button and prints the same format, to the ESPHome log.

## Multiple Devices

When several ESP devices share one MQTT broker, the firmware appends the meter serial number to the MQTT Client ID so that each client is unique. This avoids connection conflicts and keeps Home Assistant availability tracking accurate.

**Example:** With `SECRET_MQTT_CLIENT_ID = "EverblueCyble"` and `METER_CODE = "23-1234567-234"`, the parsed serial is `1234567` and the final Client ID becomes `"EverblueCyble-1234567"`.

## Home Assistant Best Practice: Utility Meter Helper

**Recommended:** Create a Home Assistant Utility Meter helper to preserve historical data across platform or meter changes.

**Why?** If you switch between MQTT and ESPHome, change meter serial numbers, or replace hardware, a utility meter helper acts as a stable interface. You update the source sensor in the helper configuration, and all your historical data, dashboards, and automations remain intact.

**Setup:**

1. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services** → **Helpers**
2. Click **Create Helper** → **Utility Meter**
3. Configure:
   - **Name**: "Master Water Meter" (or "Master Gas Meter")
   - **Input sensor**: Select your current volume sensor (e.g., `sensor.water_volume`)
   - **Meter type**: Select appropriate cycle (daily/monthly/yearly) or none
   - **Tariffs**: Optional, leave blank for simple usage

**Benefits:**

- Historical data preserved when changing platforms (MQTT ↔ ESPHome)
- Meter serial number changes are simple
- Single point to update if you replace hardware
- All dashboards and automations reference the stable utility meter entity

**Example YAML (if configuring manually):**

```yaml
utility_meter:
  master_water_meter:
    source: sensor.water_volume
    name: Master Water Meter
```

When you change platforms or meters, update the `source` to point to the new sensor. Your history remains unbroken.

### Migrating Sensor History Between Platforms

**Migrating from MQTT to ESPHome (or replacing hardware)?** A utility meter helper protects future data, but it does not move the history that already accumulated on your *old* sensor onto the *new* one. To merge the past readings from the old entity into the new entity (both raw states and long-term statistics for the Energy dashboard), use the [HA Merge Sensor History](https://github.com/mayerwin/HA-Merge-Sensor-History) custom component. It imports the older history in front of the new sensor in a single atomic, idempotent transaction, so your consumption graphs and lifetime totals stay continuous across the switch. Back up your recorder database first.

### Historical Data from Meter

Both MQTT and ESPHome modes expose a **history sensor** containing up to 13 months of historical readings stored in the meter itself. This data is retrieved directly from the meter and provided in JSON format.

**Example JSON payload:**

```json
{
  "history": [667441, 684214, 700917, 712720, 721549, 728836, 736957, 744959, 752026, 759559, 770165, 779789, 792364],
  "monthly_usage": [16773, 16703, 11803, 8829, 7287, 8121, 8002, 7067, 7533, 10606, 9624, 12575],
  "current_month_usage": 7276,
  "months_available": 13
}
```

**Fields:**

- `history`: Array of up to 13 monthly readings (oldest to newest) in litres or m³
- `monthly_usage`: Array of monthly consumption values (differences between successive history snapshots)
- `current_month_usage`: Current month's consumption so far
- `months_available`: Number of months of data available (typically 13)

**Use Cases:**

- Import historical consumption into Home Assistant on first setup
- Analyse past usage patterns
- Compare current usage to previous months
- Bootstrap energy dashboards with existing data
- Verify meter readings against utility bills

**Accessing the data:**

- **MQTT**: Available in topic `everblu/cyble/{PARSED_SERIAL}/history`
- **ESPHome**: Available as text sensor `sensor.{device}_history`

**Tip:** Parse this JSON in Home Assistant using a template sensor to extract individual months or calculate averages.

## Configuration

<details>
<summary>Expand: full configuration reference</summary>

### Local Development Setup

1. **Install Required Tools**
   - Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
   - Install the [PlatformIO extension for VS Code](https://platformio.org/).
   - This will install all required dependencies and may require restarting VS Code.

2. **Prepare Configuration Files**
   - Copy `include/private.example.h` to `include/private.h`.
   - Update the following details in `private.h`:
     - Wi-Fi and MQTT credentials. If your MQTT setup does not require a username and password, comment out those lines using `//`.
     - **Meter Code** - Copy the code under the barcode (ignore the manufacturing date):
       - Label format: `YY-SSSSSSS-NNN` (example: `23-1875247-234`)
       - Set `METER_CODE` to the same value **with dashes** - suffix `-NNN` is optional
       - Year is parsed from the first 2 digits (`YY`)
       - Serial is parsed from the middle section (`SSSSSSS`) and used in topics/entity prefixes
       - Last 3 digits (`NNN`), if present, are ignored by the radio protocol
     - Example:

       ```cpp
       // Label text: 23-1875247-234  (with suffix, 12 digits)
       #define METER_CODE "23-1875247-234"

       // Same meter, without suffix (9 digits - also valid)
       #define METER_CODE "23-1875247"

       // Label with leading zeros in serial: 23-0123456-234
       #define METER_CODE "23-0123456-234"
       ```

     - ![Cyble Meter Label](docs/images/meter_label.jpg)
     - **Wi-Fi PHY Mode**: To enable 802.11g Wi-Fi PHY mode, set `ENABLE_WIFI_PHY_MODE_11G` to `1` in the `private.h` file. By default, it is set to `0` (disabled).
     - Radio debug: control verbose CC1101/RADIAN debug output with `DEBUG_CC1101` in `private.h`.
       - `#define DEBUG_CC1101 1` enables verbose radio debugging (default in the example file).
       - `#define DEBUG_CC1101 0` disables verbose radio debugging.

3. **Select Your Board Environment**
   - Use the PlatformIO status bar at the bottom of VS Code to select your board:
     - `env:huzzah` - Adafruit HUZZAH ESP8266 (USB upload)
     - `env:huzzah-ota` - Adafruit HUZZAH ESP8266 (OTA upload)
     - `env:d1_mini` - WeMos D1 Mini (USB upload)
     - `env:d1_mini-ota` - WeMos D1 Mini (OTA upload)
     - `env:d1_mini_pro` - WeMos D1 Mini Pro (USB upload)
     - `env:d1_mini_pro-ota` - WeMos D1 Mini Pro (OTA upload)
     - `env:nodemcuv2` - NodeMCU v2 (USB upload)
     - `env:nodemcuv2-ota` - NodeMCU v2 (OTA upload)
     - `env:esp32dev` - ESP32 DevKit (USB upload)
     - `env:esp32dev-ota` - ESP32 DevKit (OTA upload)
   - **For first-time setup**: Use the standard environment (without `-ota`)
   - **For OTA updates**: After your device is running on Wi-Fi, use the `-ota` environment and update the IP address in `platformio.ini`
   - See the "Quick Start" section above for detailed build and upload instructions

4. **Perform Frequency Discovery (First-Time Setup)**
   - On the very first boot (or anytime there is no stored frequency offset), the firmware automatically launches a wide scan while `AUTO_SCAN_ENABLED` is set to `1` (default).
   - If you need to skip the scan during development (for example, when you already know the meter's frequency), add `#define AUTO_SCAN_ENABLED 0` to your `include/private.h`.
   - Compile and upload the code to your ESP device using PlatformIO. Use **PlatformIO > Upload and Monitor**.
   - **Keep the device connected to your computer during this process.** The serial monitor will display debug output as the device scans frequencies in the 433 MHz range.
  - Scans advance between complete radio transactions while the main loop services MQTT. Each transaction takes several seconds, and refinement can add minutes. Follow the phase messages in the logs or status entity.
   - Once the correct frequency is identified, update the `FREQUENCY` value in `private.h` if needed (the automatic scan stores the offset, so manual adjustment is usually not required).
  - Use **Frequency Scan** for a local search around saved tuning with automatic wide fallback, or **Deep Frequency Scan** to start across ±150 kHz. **Stop Frequency Scan** cancels at the next transaction boundary. Both modes bracket and refine a discovered response window, then verify before saving. Enabling `AUTO_SCAN_ENABLED` does not replace an existing calibration; use the button to recalibrate.
   - **Automatic recovery on failure**: Separately from the first-boot scan, when a full streak of read attempts fails (`MAX_RETRIES` reached) and the firmware enters its cooldown period, it can run a frequency scan once to check for meter carrier-frequency (crystal) drift. This is controlled by `AUTO_SCAN_ON_FAILURE_ENABLED` (default `0`, opt-in). Set `#define AUTO_SCAN_ON_FAILURE_ENABLED 1` in `include/private.h` to enable it; it runs at most once per failure streak (reset after the next successful read).
   - For best results, perform this step during local business hours when the meter is most likely to transmit. Refer to the "Frequency Adjustment" section below for additional guidance.

5. **Build and Upload**
   - Follow the build and upload instructions in the "Quick Start" section above.
   - For first-time setup, use USB upload with the standard environment (e.g., `env:huzzah`).
   - Keep the device connected to your computer during USB upload.

6. **Verify Meter Data**
   - After WiFi and MQTT connection is established (or after the initial frequency scan completes), the meter data should appear in the terminal (bottom panel) and be pushed to MQTT.
   - If Frequency Discovery is still enabled, its output will also be displayed during this step.
   - **Note**: On first boot with no stored frequency offset, there will be a ~2 minute delay before any MQTT activity while the wide frequency scan runs. This is normal; monitor the serial output to see progress.

7. **Automatic Meter Query**
   - The device will automatically query the meter once every 24 hours.
   - If the query fails, it will retry every hour until successful.

<summary>Continuous Integration (for contributors)</summary>

This project uses GitHub Actions to build, test, and run quality checks on every push and pull request, so both platforms stay compatible.

The CI workflows include:

- **Build Workflows**: Builds the project for both ESP8266 (huzzah) and ESP32 (esp32dev) platforms to validate that the code compiles successfully
- **Code Quality**: Runs static analysis using cppcheck and formatting checks with clang-format to identify potential issues and maintain code consistency
- **Dependency Caching**: Caches dependencies for faster builds
- **Artifact Upload**: Uploads firmware artifacts and quality reports for successful builds

### Reading Schedule

The **Reading Schedule** feature allows you to configure the days when the meter should be queried.
By default, the schedule is set to `Monday-Friday`.
You can change this in the `private.h` file by modifying the `DEFAULT_READING_SCHEDULE`.

Available options:

- `"Monday-Friday"`: Queries the meter only on weekdays.
- `"Monday-Saturday"`: Queries the meter from Monday to Saturday.
- `"Monday-Sunday"`: Queries the meter every day.
- `"Monday"`, `"Tuesday"`, `"Wednesday"`, `"Thursday"`, `"Friday"`, `"Saturday"`, `"Sunday"`: Queries the meter only on that day.

Example configuration in `private.h`:

```cpp
#define DEFAULT_READING_SCHEDULE "Monday-Saturday"

```

### Time zone offset and wake-up window (simple)

Meters often have a local wake window (Time Start/End). The firmware keeps its clock in UTC and applies a simple offset:

Configuration (in `include/private.h`):

```cpp
// Minutes from UTC. Examples: 0 (UTC), 60 (UTC+1), -300 (UTC-5)
#define TIMEZONE_OFFSET_MINUTES 0

```

Behaviour:

- The device schedules reads using UTC+offset (your local time). The default read time is 10:00 (local by offset).
- Auto-align can shift the read hour to the meter's wake window (midpoint by default) in local-offset time; the UTC publish is derived from that.

MQTT topics exposed:

- `everblu/cyble/reading_time`: scheduled time in UTC (HH:MM)

In serial logs at startup you’ll see:

- The UTC time pulled from the time server
- The configured offset (minutes)
- The local (UTC+offset) time

---

### Home Assistant Discovery Toggle (MQTT mode)

By default, the standalone MQTT firmware publishes Home Assistant discovery topics under `homeassistant/...` so entities are created automatically.

If you only want raw MQTT topics and do not use Home Assistant discovery, set this in `include/private.h`:

```cpp
#define ENABLE_HA_DISCOVERY 0
```

Default behaviour (if not defined) is enabled:

```cpp
#define ENABLE_HA_DISCOVERY 1
```

With discovery disabled, telemetry and command topics under `everblu/cyble/...` continue to work normally.
If discovery was enabled previously, retained `homeassistant/...` config topics may remain on the broker until you clear them (or switch to a different discovery prefix), so existing Home Assistant entities may not disappear immediately.

---

### Radio and frequency (advanced)

Most users can skip this section: the firmware auto-calibrates, and on first boot it runs a wide scan if no frequency offset is stored.

<details>
<summary>Frequency configuration and adaptive tracking</summary>

### Frequency Configuration

The firmware auto-calibrates the CC1101 frequency. The base frequency is configured at compile time in `private.h`.

#### How it works

1. **Base frequency**: Set with `FREQUENCY` in `private.h` (e.g., `#define FREQUENCY 433.82`).
2. **Default**: If `FREQUENCY` is not defined, it defaults to **433.82 MHz** (RADIAN centre frequency for EverBlu). A warning is logged.
3. **Calibration**: CC1101 synthesiser calibration runs automatically; the firmware also triggers a manual calibration during init.
4. **FOC**: Frequency Offset Compensation is enabled to handle small drift during reception.
5. **Not published to MQTT**: It’s a low-level setting and already visible in the serial startup log.

#### Example

```cpp
// Optional: base frequency in MHz
// If not defined, defaults to 433.82 MHz
#define FREQUENCY 433.82

```

Ways to find the best frequency:

1. Let the first-boot wide scan run (default).
2. Measure with an RTL-SDR while a utility reader is polling the meter.
3. Start with 433.82 MHz and adjust slightly if needed (often ±0.01 MHz).

The effective frequency is printed at startup:

```text
> Frequency (effective): 433.820000 MHz
```

---

### Adaptive Frequency Management

To handle CC1101 crystal tolerance, the firmware can adapt over time:

1. **Wide scan (first boot)**: If no offset is stored, scans ±100 kHz around the base frequency (~1–2 minutes).
2. **Tracking**: After successful reads, averages frequency error and updates the stored offset when it’s consistently off.
3. **FOC tuned**: CC1101 FOC is configured for EverBlu/RADIAN frames.

#### When to clear EEPROM

Clear EEPROM when you change hardware or meter:

- Replace the ESP8266/ESP32
- Replace the CC1101 module
- Move to a different meter

In `include/private.h`, set:

```cpp
#define CLEAR_EEPROM_ON_BOOT 1

```

Upload, let it boot once (wide scan runs), then set it back to:

```cpp
#define CLEAR_EEPROM_ON_BOOT 0

```

See `ADAPTIVE_FREQUENCY_FEATURES.md` for deeper technical notes.

## Troubleshooting

### Meter reads fail: near-field RF saturation (device too close to meter)

**Symptoms:**

- Log shows `*** NEAR-FIELD SATURATION DETECTED (RSSI=−31 dBm) ***`
- RSSI is very high (> −50 dBm), often a flat plateau across a wide frequency band
- Data frames ARE received (hex dumps with the correct `7C 11 00 45 20 0A` header visible in logs)
- Every frame fails CRC despite a strong signal
- Running a frequency scan shows a flat −31 dBm plateau across ~40 kHz rather than a single peaked response

**Cause:**

The CC1101's front-end amplifier has a limited input range. When the device is placed immediately next to the meter the received signal exceeds that range, the input stage clips, and the demodulated bit stream is corrupted. This produces CRC failures even with an excellent RSSI reading. It is the **opposite** of a weak-signal problem.

**Solution:**

Move the device at least **1–2 m away** from the meter. At normal installation distance the RSSI should be around −60 to −85 dBm, well within the linear range. If the device must be permanently mounted close to the meter, set `RX_ATTENUATION_DB` in `include/private.h` to engage the CC1101 front-end LNA gain limiter:

```cpp
// Values: 0 (default), 6, 12, 18 (dB)
#define RX_ATTENUATION_DB 6
```

Start with `6` and increase if CRC failures persist at close range. At normal distance keep this at `0`.

### Corrupted or Invalid Volume Readings

**Symptoms:**

- Volume reads as 0, very small values, or negative numbers
- Historical data shows impossible decreases
- Battery showing as 0 months
- CRC passes but data is clearly wrong

**Solution:**
Enable hex dump debugging to see the raw 200-byte decoded frame:

**ESPHome:** Add `debug_cc1101: true` to your YAML config  
**MQTT:** Set `#define DEBUG_CC1101 1` in `include/private.h`

This outputs detailed byte-by-byte data to help identify:

- Wrong byte offsets for your specific meter variant
- Regional/manufacturing date differences in data layout
- Corrupted fields causing parsing errors

### ESP32 build: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'intelhex'

This is a PlatformIO tooling dependency that `esptool.py` uses to build the ESP32 bootloader and partition images. It is not part of this project and is not committed to the repo. PlatformIO usually installs it automatically, but on some Windows setups it can be missing.

Try the following in order:

- Upgrade PlatformIO core and the Espressif32 platform (from PlatformIO Home → Platforms → Updates), or using the PIO terminal:

  ```powershell
  & "$env:USERPROFILE\.platformio\penv\Scripts\platformio.exe" upgrade
  & "$env:USERPROFILE\.platformio\penv\Scripts\platformio.exe" platform update espressif32
  ```

- If it still fails, install the package into PlatformIO’s embedded Python (use the PlatformIO terminal to ensure the right interpreter is used):

  ```powershell
  & "$env:USERPROFILE\.platformio\penv\Scripts\python.exe" -m pip install --disable-pip-version-check --no-warn-script-location intelhex
  ```

- Re-run the ESP32 build explicitly through PlatformIO’s bundled executable:

  ```powershell
  & "$env:USERPROFILE\.platformio\penv\Scripts\platformio.exe" run --environment esp32dev
  ```

Notes

- Only ESP32 builds use this dependency; ESP8266 builds do not require `intelhex`.
- Prefer the PlatformIO terminal over a global Python to avoid installing into the wrong environment.
- If `pio` is not recognised in PowerShell, use the full executable path above instead of `pio run ...`.

### ESP32 compile errors about ESP8266 headers

The code now conditionally includes headers based on the target (ESP8266 vs ESP32).
If you still see includes like `ESP8266WiFi.h` during an ESP32 build, ensure you selected the `esp32dev` environment and not an ESP8266 one.

### Frequency Adjustment

Your transceiver module may not be calibrated correctly. Adjust the frequency slightly lower or higher and try again, or use an RTL-SDR to measure the required offset and rerun the frequency discovery.

### Business Hours

> [!TIP]
> Your meter may be configured to listen for requests only during business hours to conserve energy.
> If you are unable to communicate with the meter, try again during business hours (8:00–16:00), Monday to Friday.
> As a rule of thumb, set up your device during business hours to avoid confusion and unnecessary troubleshooting.
> This is particularly relevant in the UK.

### Serial Number Starting with 0

Ignore the leading 0 and provide the serial number in the configuration without it.

### Distance Between Device and Meter

A CC1101 433 MHz module with an external wire-coil antenna typically reaches 300 to 500 m, and SMA boards with high-gain antennas can extend that further. In practice, keep the radio close enough to the meter for a reliable link rather than chasing maximum range.

---

## Important: Utility Read Counter Compatibility

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The meter includes a built-in **read counter** that increments each time it's queried. When your water/gas company performs wireless readings, they expect this counter to match their scheduled read count. **This behaviour comes from the RADIAN protocol and meter hardware, not from MQTT or the ESP.**

If you regularly read your meter yourself:

- The counter will be **higher than expected** when the utility reads it
- Their equipment may flag this discrepancy or refuse to download data
- They may suspect tampering or out-of-sync equipment

### Recommended Actions

1. **Record your initial counter value** when you first start using this device (check the Home Assistant sensor or MQTT topic `/counter`).
2. **If the utility reports issues**:
   - They can still take a **manual reading** from the physical meter display (traditional method).
   - Or you can **loop the counter** back to the expected value: the read counter wraps at 255 back to 0, so making enough reads before their scheduled visit can "reset" it (automate this in Home Assistant if needed).

**Note:** Most utilities won't notice or care, but it's good to be aware of this if they mention unexpected counter values during their wireless reading attempts.
