# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

Releases are created manually by tagging commits with version tags matching `v*.*.*` (e.g., `v2.1.0`). Users should build from source and configure `private.h` with their own meter settings.

## AI Notes For Maintainers And Tools

- Treat release sections as the source of truth for shipped behavior.
- The `Unreleased` section is for in-progress work and may be rewritten before tagging.
- If an item was introduced and later superseded in the same release branch, keep only the final behavior in Added/Changed/Fixed/Removed and record superseded work in the AI metadata block.
- Keep PR coverage explicit per release so branch-only work is auditable against merge history.
- Add new versions below, not above this section.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Read-only Full FDR interval history for supported Cyble Enhanced water meters,
  requested manually with a fresh meter clock. Standalone MQTT provides a retained
  JSON archive and Home Assistant discovery with `ENABLE_FULL_FDR=1` (disabled by
  default). ESPHome provides a separate `fdr_history_json` output and manual button.
  History follows the meter's monthly, weekly, daily or hourly configuration;
  monthly operation is hardware-tested, with synthetic tests for other periods.
  Normal readings and history are unchanged. See [Full FDR setup](docs/full-fdr.md).

```

> **⚠️ BREAKING CHANGE** - The ESPHome `history` text sensor no longer carries the cumulative `history` array. Home Assistant templates that read `history.history[...]` require migration (see below). The MQTT / standalone build is unaffected.

### Breaking Changes

- **Cumulative `history` array removed from the ESPHome history JSON** ([#67](https://github.com/genestealer/everblu-meters-esp8266-improved/issues/67)): Home Assistant rejects entity states longer than 255 characters and renders the entity as `unknown`. Thirteen seven-digit cumulative readings pushed the document past that limit, which is why the sensor went unknown. The payload is now:

  ```json
  {"monthly_usage": [16773, 16703, ...], "current_month_usage": 7276, "months_available": 13}
  ```

  The deltas in `monthly_usage` are small enough to always fit. The MQTT build publishes history as an attribute, which has no length limit, so it is unchanged and still carries the full cumulative series.

### Migration Required

- **If you have a template reading `history.history[-1]`** (the newest cumulative snapshot), derive it from the volume sensor instead: `volume - current_month_usage`. The two are equal by definition, since `current_month_usage` is that difference. Updated templates are in `ESPHOME/docs/ESPHOME_HOME_ASSISTANT_INTEGRATION.md`.
- **If you only use `monthly_usage`, `current_month_usage` or `months_available`**, no action is needed.
- **Multi-meter ESPHome setups must move the calibration entities onto every meter.** `frequency_offset`, `tuned_frequency`, `frequency_estimate`, `deep_scan_button` and `reset_frequency_button` used to be radio-global, and `example-multi-meter.yaml` told you to declare them on the first meter only. They are now per meter, so a YAML carried forward unchanged leaves meters 2 and up calibrating silently with no entities to show it. Copy the block onto each entry; `example-multi-meter.yaml` shows the new layout.
- **Run a scan for each meter after upgrading.** The old shared offset has no meter identity and is not imported, so every meter starts from its configured base frequency until its own scan has run.

### Added

- **Opt-in to disable automatic scheduled readings** ([#159](https://github.com/genestealer/everblu-meters-esp8266-improved/issues/159)): `DISABLE_SCHEDULED_READINGS` in `include/private.h` (default `0`) and `disable_scheduled_readings` in the ESPHome YAML (default `false`), threaded through `IConfigProvider::areScheduledReadingsDisabled()`. The daily read is skipped; manual and on-demand reads still work, so a meter can be read only when you ask for it. Useful where the utility's own read counter matters, or for a meter you only want to sample occasionally.
- **`Frequency Scan` and `Stop Frequency Scan` buttons on the standalone MQTT build**, on the `everblu/cyble/<serial>/scan` and `.../stop_scan` topics. Scan searches around the saved tuning and widens automatically if nothing answers, which is the cheap first move when a working meter goes quiet; the existing `Deep Frequency Scan` still starts across the full ±150 kHz. Stop cancels at the next transaction boundary and restores the previous tuning, so a scan started by mistake no longer has to be waited out or the device rebooted.
- **A per-meter `scan_button` in ESPHome**, alongside the existing deep scan, reset and stop buttons, and `frequency_estimate` is now a per-meter sensor rather than one shared value.
- **The host CC1101 simulation now models the FIFOs**, so `get_meter_data_for_meter()` runs end to end on a desktop against the captures in `test/fixtures/meter_frames/raw_frames.lst`: wake-up burst, both receive stages, the oversampled decode, the CRC check and the parser, plus the failure modes. Two more host environments, `env:native_cc1101_debug` and `env:native_cc1101_legacy`, build the same suite with `debug_cc1101` and with `DISABLE_GDO2_FIFO_MANAGEMENT`. Adds the `home_003` / `raw_259301_c` fixtures and tests for the calibration, scheduling and reporting paths this release touched.

### Changed

- **ESPHome history sensor always publishes a parseable document** ([#67](https://github.com/genestealer/everblu-meters-esp8266-improved/issues/67)): a reading that decoded no history, and the state published at boot, are now a valid empty document rather than `unavailable`, so templates parsing the JSON never see `unknown`. History is published on every successful read, so a read without history clears the sensor rather than leaving the previous reading's payload in place.
- **Per-meter ESPHome calibration:** each meter has independent base frequency, saved offset, adaptive tracking and frequency sensors. Add Scan, Deep Scan, Reset and Stop buttons to each entry. Reads reapply that meter's tuning; another meter cannot reset or cancel an active scan. Run a scan for each meter after upgrading: the old shared offset has no meter identity and is not imported.
- **Staged scans in both targets:** wide acquisition uses nominal 10 kHz jumps, with one nominal 2.5 kHz fallback pass if empty. From the first response the scanner samples nine settings spanning ±9.5 kHz, twice each, ranks decode reliability before FREQEST, and confirms the candidate before saving. A response that cannot be reproduced is treated as a false start and the sweep carries on from where it left off, up to twice per scan. Local recovery starts around the saved tuning and widens if empty. MQTT scans now step from the main loop rather than blocking it, so Wi-Fi and MQTT stay serviced for the duration.
- **Calibration safeguards:** cancelled or unsuccessful scans restore previous tuning, radio faults abort, first-time calibration requires verification, and stored offsets support the full ±150 kHz scan range. Frequency-word conversion now rounds to the nearest register value. FREQEST is captured at data-frame sync rather than after decoding and logging.
- **Confirmation read after a scan verifies a tuning:** a scan only reaches its verified outcome by decoding frames, so the meter is awake at that moment. Previously the reader published the new offset and went idle, leaving a recovery scan to sit out the full `retry_cooldown` on a calibration that had just been proven to work. It now takes one read on the tuning it verified, reported as `Confirming new calibration`. It is a single attempt: a miss ends the failure streak rather than starting a fresh retry cycle, and does not trigger another scan. A scan started by a failed read takes that reading even when it re-confirms the offset already stored, since the meter has just answered either way; a scan you press yourself queues nothing when the offset is unchanged.

### Fixed

- **One unlucky recovery scan no longer disables automatic recovery for good.** The scan that follows a failed read was armed again only by a successful read. Meters answer on their own schedule, so a scan that swept while the meter happened to be silent found nothing, and from then on the firmware retried the old frequency every day without ever scanning again. The drift the scan exists to correct could then only be cleared by pressing Scan by hand. Each scheduled reading now arms one fresh attempt, so a genuinely unreachable meter (a flat battery, say) still costs at most one scan per scheduled reading. Both builds.
- **A meter that goes quiet and returns on its usual frequency is now read straight away.** The reading owed after a recovery scan was taken only when the scan changed the stored offset, so a meter that came back on the tuning already saved was left unread until the hour-long cooldown expired, despite having answered repeatedly during the scan moments earlier. Both builds.
- **Reset Frequency Offset now clears the stored calibration instead of saving a zero.** A stored zero still counts as calibrated, so a reset meter could not start a first-boot automatic scan, and any frequency a later scan found had to beat that zero in the stored-calibration quality guard. The value is now erased. If flash refuses the erase, the offset is left alone and the reason is published to the Last Error sensor rather than reporting a silent success. Both builds ([#104](https://github.com/genestealer/everblu-meters-esp8266-improved/issues/104)).
- **A frequency scan no longer maps the meter's duty cycle and calls it a response band.** From the first successful decode the scanner used to walk outwards until five consecutive misses closed each edge, then sweep everything between them at 793 Hz. That assumes a miss means the tuning is wrong. It does not: the CC1101 runs a 270 kHz receive filter with offset compensation across ±67.7 kHz, so the meter decodes over a span far wider than the scan's resolution, and a miss almost always means the meter was not transmitting at that moment. A field log shows the consequence: the same setting, 433.819061 MHz, read `reads=0 RSSI=-107` at 18:31:55 and `reads=189 RSSI=-79` ninety seconds later. The scan mapped a 171 kHz "band", queued a 25 minute sweep of it, and set an upper edge that excluded the frequency the meter was known to answer on. Acquisition is unchanged; from the first response the scanner now samples four steps either side at 2.380 kHz, twice each, and goes straight to verification. The window is clipped in whole steps, so a response near the end of the scan range is still sampled rather than having the grid shifted off it, and a response that refinement cannot reproduce resumes the sweep instead of ending the scan. Cost after the first response is fixed at around 20 reads instead of scaling with the width of the band. Both builds ([#104](https://github.com/genestealer/everblu-meters-esp8266-improved/issues/104)).
- **Pressing Stop on the wrong meter no longer appears to do nothing.** One CC1101 is shared, but each meter has its own Stop button and only the meter that started a scan can cancel it. The other meters now log and publish `Scan belongs to meter NN-NNNNNN - use that meter's Stop button` to their Last Error sensor instead of silently ignoring the press. ESPHome multi-meter setups only.
- **Frame hex dumps are suppressed during a frequency scan.** `debug_cc1101: true` made every scan step dump the raw and decoded frames, which is what the scan's own log suppression was meant to prevent; the hex dumper wrote to the log directly and escaped it. One reported scan log was 35% frame dumps. High-level scan progress is unchanged.
- **The fine sweep window in the log now matches the window actually swept.** It reported the bracket edges rather than the sweep bounds, understating each end by one bracketing step (~2.4 kHz). The bracketing stage has since been replaced, and the refinement logs the window it samples.
- **A multi-meter setup no longer has one meter's `frequency:` silently overwrite every other meter's.** `FrequencyManager::begin()` was called once per entry against a single global base frequency, so whichever entry initialised last decided the frequency for all of them, and a scan always swept around that value rather than the triggering meter's. This was documented as a limitation in v3.4.0 and as a warning in `example-multi-meter.yaml`; each meter now keeps its own base frequency, and the warnings are gone.
- **The standalone build re-ran the startup deep scan on every boot when the stored offset was genuinely 0.0 kHz.** `main.cpp` inferred "nothing stored" from `offset == 0.0f`, so a device whose crystal is on spec never recognised its own saved calibration and spent roughly two minutes scanning before every connection to MQTT. It now asks `FrequencyManager` whether a calibration was actually stored. ESPHome already used that flag.
- **The standalone build ignored the configured reading schedule's day of week.** `main.cpp` never called `ScheduleManager::setSchedule()`, so a `DEFAULT_READING_SCHEDULE` of, for example, weekdays only was printed in the logs and published in Home Assistant discovery while the reading day was still picked from the default. ESPHome was unaffected.
- **An unrecognised reading schedule is now reported rather than silently never matching.** A schedule string that matched none of the presets or weekday names made `isReadingDay()` return false for every day, so the device simply never took a scheduled reading and said nothing about why. It now logs `Unknown reading_schedule '<value>'; skipping scheduled read.` The ESPHome schema already rejects an invalid value at config time, so this affects the standalone build in practice.
- **A scheduled read could be lost for the whole day.** Both schedulers fired only when a poll happened to observe `tm_sec == 0`, a one-second window per day, so a blocking read, a frequency scan or a Wi-Fi reconnect spanning that second silently skipped the day's reading. The read now fires anywhere inside the scheduled minute, latched to one occurrence per day.
- **The schedule no longer latches on an unset clock or while a scan owns the radio.** `onScheduled()` waits for a plausible epoch before matching, so the 1970 clock at boot cannot satisfy a 00:00 schedule and consume that day's read. Both schedulers now defer instead of latching during a frequency scan, where the read would previously have been dropped and lost until the next day. A deferred occurrence is remembered rather than only retried while the scheduled minute is still current: a staged scan, or the hour-long cooldown after a failed read, easily outlasts that minute, and the day's read is now taken as soon as the radio is free. The once-per-day latch is keyed on the full date rather than `tm_yday`, which restarts at 0 every January and suppressed the next year's occurrence of the same day.
- **NTP sync no longer stalls the MQTT connect callback** on the standalone build. It spun in a `delay()` loop for up to 10 seconds waiting for the clock on every reconnect, holding up `mqtt.loop()` and `ArduinoOTA.handle()` with it. `configTzTime()` is now kicked off and the callback returns; a non-blocking poll in `loop()` watches the clock and logs the outcome once.
- **A very weak signal was reported as "too strong".** The dBm conversion returned `int8_t`, but the weakest readings map below -128 dBm (register value 128 converts to -138), which wrapped to a positive number and satisfied the `> -50 dBm` near-field saturation heuristic. The conversion, the diagnostic struct field and the local variables are now `int`, and the function is declared in `cc1101.h` so the boundary tests can cover the whole 0-255 register range.
- **The ESPHome manual-read and deep-scan buttons are guarded like the others.** They only null-checked the meter reader, unlike the scan and reset buttons, which also require an initialised radio and reject a press while a scan or read is already running. A deep scan could therefore be launched on an unconfigured or busy radio. The standalone build's `Reset Frequency Offset`, `Deep Frequency Scan` and `Diagnostic Report` commands are now guarded the same way, so clearing the calibration or probing the radio part way through a scan or a retry sequence is rejected instead of acted on.
- **The `Status` text sensor in `example-advanced.yaml` was missing the `id` its own `on_value` automation refers to**, so the example failed to compile as published.
- **The release workflow no longer interpolates its `workflow_dispatch` tag input into a shell command.** The tag and version are passed through the environment and the input is validated against the `v*.*.*` shape, closing a script-injection path open to anyone able to trigger the workflow.

### Removed

- **`averageMonthlyUsage`** from `HistoryStats` and `calculateStats()`. It divided the total usage by `monthCount + 1`, counting the phantom oldest month (whose usage is always 0) as a period, so the figure was wrong. Nothing read it: it was never published over MQTT or the ESPHome API, and the only consumer was a unit test that asserted the buggy result and so locked the defect in. Rather than invent a definition for an undocumented metric, the field is gone.
- **`echo_cc1101_version()` and `show_cc1101_registers_settings()`** from the CC1101 driver. Both dumped register state to the serial log, and neither had a caller anywhere in the firmware. Being non-`static` with no declaration in `cc1101.h`, they raised no unused-function warning and were compiled into every build of both targets. `cc1101_print_diagnostic_report()` already reports the part number, version and key registers in a form meant for pasting into a bug report.

  - "GitHub releases no longer carry prebuilt firmware binaries; users build from source with their own private.h"
```

### Breaking Changes

- **The ESPHome component now requires ESPHome 2026.1.0 or later.** `dump_config()` and the new diagnostic report print their pin assignments through `GPIOPin::dump_summary(char *, size_t)` and `GPIO_SUMMARY_MAX_LEN`, which first shipped in that release. Config validation enforces the floor with `cv.require_esphome_version()`, so an older install now fails during validation with a clear message instead of part-way through the C++ compile. The standalone PlatformIO build is unaffected.
- **A frame whose length byte claims more bytes than were decoded is now discarded.** Previously `radian_validate_crc()` returned "valid" without verifying anything in this case, so a truncated or misaligned capture bypassed the only integrity gate on the radio path and left the downstream parser sanity checks to catch the damage. If a meter's frames are consistently truncated, this turns intermittently-corrupt readings into no readings, so the failure is now logged distinctly: `Frame truncated: length byte claims N bytes, only M decoded - the CRC trailer was never received` rather than the generic CRC message, which sent people looking at the aerial and the frequency. The captured `home_001` test fixture is one of these frames and is now marked `crc_valid=0`; parse coverage for the same meter comes from the complete `home_002` frame.

### Added

- **`diagnostic_report_button`**: a new optional button that logs a single copy-pasteable block containing the configured CS/GDO0/GDO2 pins, a live SPI link self-test, the key CC1101 registers (PARTNUM, VERSION, MARCSTATE, FREQ2/1/0, MDMCFG4/3/2, PKTCTRL0), RSSI/LQI and the current GDO0/GDO2 line levels. It deliberately does not require the meter reader to be initialised, because the most common reason to press it is that the radio never came up.
- **`Diagnostic Report` MQTT button**: the standalone MQTT build exposes the same report as a Home Assistant button and on the `<base>/diagnostic_report` topic (payload `report`). The report body was moved into the shared CC1101 driver, so both integrations print byte-for-byte comparable blocks and a bug report needs only one set of instructions. As well as going to the serial / WiFi serial log, the report is published retained to `<base>/diagnostic_report_state` and surfaced as a `Diagnostic Report` sensor whose state is the time it was taken and whose `report` attribute holds the text, so it can be read from Home Assistant without a serial cable. A Home Assistant state is capped at 255 characters, hence the attribute.
- **GDO0 wiring self-test**: `cc1101_init()` now checks that GDO0 reads LOW while the radio is IDLE, mirroring the existing GDO2 self-test. The pin is configured with a pull-up, so a wrong or unconnected GPIO reads HIGH. Previously a mis-assigned `gdo0_pin` failed silently in a way that resembled success: every sync-word wait returned immediately, producing `GDO0 triggered at 0ms` and "received" frames that were only noise. The verdict is exposed through `cc1101_collect_diagnostics()` and shown in the diagnostic report, so a fault that appears mid-life is visible rather than only at the first boot after a miswire.

### Changed

- **The SPI link self-test now runs during `setup()`**, not on the first Home Assistant connection. A stuck MISO or a wrong `cs_pin`/`miso_pin` is a hard wiring fault, and users typically capture only the boot log, which previously contained no evidence of it.
- **`dump_config()` reports the actual GPIO numbers** for the CS, GDO0 and GDO2 pins instead of just `configured`, and adds the RX attenuation setting and the SPI link self-test result. Support requests usually consist of this block alone, which could not be checked against a board pinout without the numbers.
- **The SPI write/read-back probe restores the sync word it borrowed.** `SYNC1`/`SYNC0` are the scratch pair, and the last pattern written is `0x55`/`0xAA`. `cc1101_init()` rewrites them immediately afterwards, but `cc1101_collect_diagnostics()` runs against a configured, listening radio, so without the restore the operational sync word silently became `0x55AA`.
- **The diagnostic snapshot parks the radio for the probe and puts it back.** The datasheet requires IDLE when programming `SYNC1`/`SYNC0`, and `cc1101_init()` ends in `cc1101_rec_mode()`, so the button is normally pressed on a radio sitting in RX. `cc1101_collect_diagnostics()` now captures `MARCSTATE` first, strobes `SIDLE` for the probe and re-enters RX afterwards if that is where the radio was; without it, asking for a report would have left a listening receiver deaf.
- **The GDO0 self-test verdict distinguishes "not run" from "passed".** The report works without the meter reader, so it is usually taken when the radio never came up, which is exactly when `cc1101_init()` and therefore the self-test have not run. Reporting `passed` there cleared GDO0 of a fault that was never checked. The same applies to the GDO0/GDO2 line levels, which are now reported as unknown until the pins have been given a mode rather than sampling a floating input.
- **The GDO0 warning is re-armed when the test passes.** It is still rate-limited so a frequency scan (which calls `cc1101_init()` per step) does not repeat it dozens of times, but a connection that starts failing hours into a run is now logged rather than swallowed by a boot-time one-shot.
- **`MARCSTATE` is reported by name** in the diagnostic report. As a bare number a state such as `0x11` reads as a fault, when it is usually just a receiver parked with nothing draining the FIFO (`RXFIFO_OVERFLOW`).
- **The diagnostic report decodes `FREQ2/1/0` into the actual carrier frequency** and prints it alongside the configured base. The two differ by whatever calibration offset is in effect, so reporting only the configured value hid a ~31 kHz discrepancy that could otherwise be spotted only by doing the register arithmetic by hand.
- **Standalone MQTT publishes no longer build their topics as Arduino `String`s.** A single read published around 20 topics as `String(mqttBaseTopic) + "/suffix"`, allocating and freeing two heap blocks each time and fragmenting the ~40 KB ESP8266 heap over the life of the device. A `publishSub()` helper formats the topic into a stack buffer instead, consistent with how the rest of the file already builds topics.
- **`StorageAbstraction::clearAll()` logs a warning on ESPHome** instead of silently returning `false`, so a factory-reset caller can tell the difference between a failure and a no-op. ESPHome's preference API has no bulk-erase primitive; individual keys must be cleared with `clearKey()`.
- **GitHub releases no longer build or attach prebuilt firmware binaries.** The release workflow previously built five board variants and attached the `.bin` files. Those builds used a placeholder `private.h`, so the binaries could never contain a working meter serial, Wi-Fi credentials or MQTT settings, and flashing one produced a device that could not read anything. Users build from source with their own `private.h`, which is what the README has always instructed. This removes the build matrix from `.github/workflows/release.yml` and shortens the release run considerably.

### Fixed

- **`dump_config()` was truncated mid-line on real hardware.** It emitted the whole block as a single `ESP_LOGCONFIG` call, which ran to roughly 480 characters once the RX attenuation, CS pin and SPI self-test lines were added. The logger truncates a message at its transmit buffer (512 bytes including the line header), so the block stopped at `SPI Link Self-Test: PASSED (P` and lost the PARTNUM/VERSION values, i.e. exactly the field that was added so support requests would carry it. It is now split across several calls, the same way the diagnostic report already was.
- **The unbounded `sprintf()` building the standalone `/json` payload** is now `snprintf()`, matching the rest of `src/main.cpp`.

### Removed

- **Dead diagnostic code in the CC1101 driver:** `cc1101_wait_for_packet()`, `cc1101_check_packet_received()` and `is_look_like_radian_frame()` had no callers and were not part of the `cc1101.h` public API. They also held the only unbounded call into the hex-dump helper. The live receive path is `receive_radian_frame()` and is unchanged.
- **The unreachable carry branch in `setMHZ()`.** `freq0` is a `byte`, so `if (freq0 > 255)` could never be true; the loop above it already subtracts a whole FREQ1 step before `freq0` can reach 256.

### Added

- **Frequency scan logging now names the meter being interrogated and reports the scan centre alongside that meter's configured frequency.** In a multi-meter setup (several `everblu_meter:` entries sharing one CC1101), *which meter answers* a scan is per-entry, but *which frequency range is swept* is a single value shared by every entry, set by whichever entry's `setup()` ran last. `performFrequencyScan()` and the auto-scan-on-failure warning now log the meter code and gas/water type, so a mismatch between the swept centre and an entry's configured `frequency:` is visible in the log instead of silently narrowing the scan window away from the carrier. `ESPHOME/README.md` gains a "Frequency scans in multi-meter setups" section documenting the per-meter/global split and warning that every entry sharing a radio must use the same `frequency:` ([#147](https://github.com/genestealer/everblu-meters-esp8266-improved/pull/147)).
- **`cc1101_init()` verifies the SPI link before trusting anything the radio reports.** The previous check only rejected a `VERSION` register read of `0x00` or `0xFF`, so a MISO line stuck at any other constant, floating, or held by another device on a shared bus passed, and every later read of `RSSI`, `LQI`, `MARCSTATE` and the RX FIFO returned that same byte, looking like a plausible but wrong reading. A write/read-back self-test over `SYNC1`/`SYNC0` with two complementary bit patterns runs first: a constant or undriven MISO cannot follow both, which also catches a missing device, a wrong `miso_pin`, a board bus-routing multiplexer left in the wrong position, and a second SPI device holding the line. Failure is fatal (`radio_connected` stays `false`) with a log message naming the likely cause. A device that answers correctly but inconsistently across repeated reads gets a warning instead of a hard failure, and an unrecognised-but-stable silicon revision (not `0x04` or `0x14`) is now accepted with a warning rather than rejected outright ([#150](https://github.com/genestealer/everblu-meters-esp8266-improved/pull/150), fixes [#148](https://github.com/genestealer/everblu-meters-esp8266-improved/issues/148)).
- **`env:native_cc1101`**, a new PlatformIO host test environment that links the real `src/core/cc1101.cpp` against a simulated CC1101 register file instead of the usual `FakeRadio` seam, with fault injection over MISO (stuck-at-any-constant, absent device, unstable bus). `test/native_shims/SPI.h` routes `SPI.transfer()` to a pluggable handler so the self-test above is exercised against the faults it exists to catch.

### Changed

- **The deep frequency scan is now stepped from the main loop instead of blocking it** ([#133](https://github.com/genestealer/everblu-meters-esp8266-improved/issues/133)). `FrequencyManager` gained `beginDeepFrequencyScan()`, `isScanInProgress()` and `loopScan()`, which advance the sweep one frequency at a time and keep all of the previous window-map, zoom, post-lock verification and quality-guard behaviour. `MeterReader::loop()` drives the scan, so the ESPHome API keeps being serviced and the Stop Reading button now aborts a manual scan at the next step boundary rather than being buffered until the whole scan finishes. The auto-scan after a failure streak is started the same way. `performDeepFrequencyScan()` is kept as a blocking wrapper for the standalone MQTT build, so its behaviour is unchanged ([#144](https://github.com/genestealer/everblu-meters-esp8266-improved/pull/144), [#146](https://github.com/genestealer/everblu-meters-esp8266-improved/pull/146)).
- The radio state reports `Frequency Scanning` while a manual deep scan runs, and returns to `Idle` when it ends.

```

### Added

- **Host-runnable test suites covering the service layer.** The embedded unit suite now builds and runs on the host, and new native suites exercise `MeterReader`, `FrequencyManager`, `MeterHistory`, the CC1101 transmit path and `ESPHomeDataPublisher`. A new `env:native_esphome` PlatformIO environment compiles the shared sources the way the ESPHome external component does (`USE_ESPHOME` defined, source folders flattened onto the include path) against recording sensor stubs in `test/native_esphome/`, which covers the publisher code that is otherwise `#ifdef`'d out of the MQTT build. Link seams for the CC1101, offset storage and the WiFi serial mirror live in `test/native_fakes.{h,cpp}`, and `test/native_shims/Arduino.h` supplies the minimal Arduino surface the service code needs. Both native environments build with `-fstack-protector-all`, which is what turned the hex-dump overrun below from silent corruption into a test failure ([#139](https://github.com/genestealer/everblu-meters-esp8266-improved/pull/139)).
- **`scripts/run-tests.ps1`**, which runs the same checks as CI locally (native tests, firmware builds, the ESPHome Python tests and ruff), plus `scripts/requirements-dev.txt` pinning the Python tooling those checks need.
- **A release process skill for Copilot** at `.github/skills/release/SKILL.md`, describing the end-to-end version bump, changelog, release notes, validation and tagging workflow, along with a second code review prompt under `.github/prompts/`.

### Changed

- **Log format strings are now held in flash rather than DRAM on ESP8266.** `TS_PRINTF`, `TS_PRINTLN` and the `LOG_D`/`LOG_I`/`LOG_W`/`LOG_E`/`LOG_V` macros route through `printf_P(PSTR(...))` and `println(F(...))`, and the remaining bare `Serial.print*` banner lines in `main.cpp` use the same helpers. A string literal otherwise lands in `.rodata`, which on ESP8266 is DRAM, not flash. Static RAM drops a further 10.2 percentage points. Output is unchanged. Note for contributors: on ESP8266 these macros now require a compile-time literal format string, so `TS_PRINTF(someCharPointer)` will not compile; use `TS_PRINTF("%s\n", someCharPointer)`. ESP32 and the native host build keep the plain form ([#140](https://github.com/genestealer/everblu-meters-esp8266-improved/pull/140)).
- **The WiFi serial monitor is now compiled out entirely when `WIFI_SERIAL_MONITOR_ENABLED` is `0`** (the default). The flag previously only skipped the calls to `wifiSerialBegin()`/`wifiSerialLoop()`, so the 8 KB transmit ring buffer, the 1 KB `printf` scratch buffer and the `WiFiServer`/`WiFiClient` objects were linked in regardless. Setting the flag to `1` restores the previous behaviour and its 8904-byte cost. When disabled, `Serial` is no longer remapped through the mirror and resolves to the hardware UART, and nothing named `WiFiSerial` is declared; use `Serial`, which the header remaps to the mirror when the monitor is on. ESPHome builds, which never enabled the monitor, also drop the unused buffers ([#140](https://github.com/genestealer/everblu-meters-esp8266-improved/pull/140)).
- **`WIFI_SERIAL_MONITOR_ENABLED` in `private.example.h` is now wrapped in `#ifndef`** so a build can override it with `-DWIFI_SERIAL_MONITOR_ENABLED=1` without a macro redefinition. The ESP8266 CI matrix uses that to build the HUZZAH target both with and without the monitor, and `env:native` pins it on so the mirror and its host fakes stay compiled. If you carried an older `private.h` forward, add the same `#ifndef` guard to keep command-line overrides working.
- **Combined effect of the two items above on ESP8266 static RAM: 82.5% to 58.7% of the 81920-byte budget** (67604 to 48092 bytes, a 19512-byte saving). With the WiFi serial monitor enabled the figure is 69.6%, down from 82.5%.
- **Failed reads now report which of four causes applied**, instead of always reporting `"No meter response (asleep/out of range/wrong Year/Serial)"`: no reply at all, a reply that failed CRC (marginal RF link), a reply that passed CRC but carried invalid meter fields, or a read the radio never attempted because the meter identity is unusable. Status, error and log messages point at the matching remedy. `tmeter_data` gains a `failure` field (`ReadFailure` enum); the classification is sticky across a retry sequence, and both builds report it. Note that the retry messages report the symptom of the attempt that just failed, while the final message reports the most informative symptom of the whole sequence ([#138](https://github.com/genestealer/everblu-meters-esp8266-improved/pull/138), [#141](https://github.com/genestealer/everblu-meters-esp8266-improved/pull/141)).
- **A missing or malformed `METER_CODE` no longer reports a radio symptom.** `get_meter_data()` returns without keying the transceiver when `METER_CODE` is undefined or fails to parse, and when it is called on an ESPHome build that should use `get_meter_data_for_meter()`. Those paths now classify as `ReadFailure::NotAttempted` and report `"Meter identity not configured - check METER_CODE"` rather than advising the user to check distance and antenna placement ([#141](https://github.com/genestealer/everblu-meters-esp8266-improved/pull/141)).
- **Hex dumps of long buffers wrap instead of overrunning.** `show_in_hex_one_line()` and `show_in_hex_one_line_GET()` (modes 2 and 3) previously described a single logical line whose length grew with the buffer; they now wrap at the 256-byte line buffer, so a long frame is logged across several lines rather than one. See the matching entry under Fixed.
- **ESPHome RSSI percentage values will change on upgrade.** The ESPHome publisher carried its own copy of the dBm-to-percentage conversion, mapping -120..-50 dBm onto 0-100%, while the shared helper in `utils.cpp` maps -120..-40 dBm. The same reading was therefore logged as one figure and published to Home Assistant as another: -70 dBm appeared as 62% in the device log and 71% in the `rssi_percentage` sensor. Both now use the shared helper, so ESPHome values drop slightly (-70 dBm now reports 62%, -50 dBm now reports 87% instead of 100%). Expect a one-off step down in Home Assistant history, and retune any automation thresholds set against that entity. MQTT values and the LQI percentage are unchanged ([#139](https://github.com/genestealer/everblu-meters-esp8266-improved/pull/139)).
- **The ESP32 environments are pinned to `espressif32@6.12.0`** (arduino-esp32 2.0.x). Later releases of the platform ship arduino-esp32 3.x, which drops the implicit `WiFi.h` include that `EspMQTTClient` relies on, so the MQTT build failed with `'WiFi' was not declared in this scope`. The pin should be removed once the MQTT client dependency supports arduino-esp32 3.x.
- **Ruff no longer lints Python code fences inside Markdown.** Ruff 0.16 began formatting them, and the docs deliberately carry abbreviated, illustrative and "before" snippets that are not meant to be formatter-clean. `esphome` is also now declared as third-party, because on a case-insensitive filesystem ruff's first-party detection matched the repository's own `ESPHOME/` directory and split the imports across two sections, so local runs disagreed with Linux CI.

### Fixed

- **Stack buffer overrun when dumping a long buffer in hex.** `show_in_hex_formatted()` modes 2 and 3 appended to a 256-byte stack array without wrapping. A full 124-byte RADIAN frame needs 372 characters, and because `snprintf()` returns the length it *would* have written, the write position ran past the end of the array and the remaining-space argument underflowed to a huge value instead of clamping. The helper now wraps to a new line before it can overrun, and rejects a null buffer. The native test environments build with `-fstack-protector-all` so the next such bug aborts instead of corrupting memory silently ([#139](https://github.com/genestealer/everblu-meters-esp8266-improved/pull/139)).
- **Stack corruption during a frequency scan.** `frequency_manager.h` carried a duplicate `struct tmeter_data` behind an `#ifndef __CC1101_H__` guard that never fired for `frequency_manager.cpp`, so that translation unit used a struct missing `meter_time` and `meter_type` (since v3.2.0). As the meter-read callback returns `tmeter_data` by value, every scan step wrote ~48 bytes past the caller's return slot. The duplicate is removed in favour of including `cc1101.h` ([#138](https://github.com/genestealer/everblu-meters-esp8266-improved/pull/138)).
- **Crash when publishing a null radio state (ESPHome).** `ESPHomeDataPublisher::publishRadioState()` guarded the null before updating the text sensor, but then dereferenced it in the `strcmp` that derives the CC1101 Connected binary sensor ([#139](https://github.com/genestealer/everblu-meters-esp8266-improved/pull/139)).
- **Post-failure cooldown was skipped when a read failed at `millis() == 0`.** The cooldown used a non-zero timestamp as its "running" flag, so a failure in the first millisecond after boot left the scheduler free to retry immediately. Both deployment paths now track it with an explicit flag: `MeterReader::m_inCooldown` for ESPHome and `g_inCooldown` in `main.cpp` for MQTT ([#139](https://github.com/genestealer/everblu-meters-esp8266-improved/pull/139), [#141](https://github.com/genestealer/everblu-meters-esp8266-improved/pull/141)).
- **`MeterHistory::generateHistoryJson()` could return a length greater than the supplied buffer** and emit a truncated, unparseable JSON document that callers would then publish. It now refuses to truncate and returns 0 ([#139](https://github.com/genestealer/everblu-meters-esp8266-improved/pull/139)).

  - "Offline decoder replay tests driven by raw pre-decode RF captures"
```

### Added

- **Meter real-time clock and type/identifier decode**, with matching ESPHome sensors (`meter_clock_sensor`, `meter_model_sensor`) and MQTT topics plus Home Assistant discovery. The clock is decoded from frame bytes [24-26, 28-30] and the ASCII identifier from [32-42], following the RADIAN reference.
- **13th (most recent) monthly history value**: the frame carries 13 months of history, not 12. The final month was previously truncated by the short capture and is now decoded.
- **Stop Reading button** (ESPHome `stop_reading_button`): cancels the current read/retry sequence and requests best-effort cancellation of an in-progress deep frequency scan (it bails at the next scan step; see [#133](https://github.com/genestealer/everblu-meters-esp8266-improved/issues/133)).
- **Diagnostics under `debug_cc1101`**: a raw pre-decode RX buffer dump and a CRC-boundary scan that reports the true frame length and CRC convention.
- **Offline decoder replay tests**: `extract-meter-fixture.py` now also emits raw pre-decode captures to `test/fixtures/meter_frames/raw_frames.lst`, and the new `test_replay_raw_meter_fixtures` native test replays them through the real decoder (`radian_decode_4bitpbit()` → CRC → parse). This covers the 4x-oversampled bit-recovery path offline, not just the parser. Seeded with three meters read twice each.

### Fixed

- **RADIAN CRC now validates end-to-end on live frames for the first time.** Two stacked defects meant the CRC was never actually checked: the raw capture truncated the frame so the CRC trailer was never received, and `radian_validate_crc()` computed the checksum over the wrong range (it skipped the length byte). The frame is 124 bytes; the CRC-16/KERMIT is computed over bytes [0..121] (including the length byte) with the trailer at [122-123]. Verified against multiple live captures.
- **`extract-meter-fixture.py` CRC check used the wrong convention**: it computed the CRC over bytes [1..], skipping the length byte, so captured fixtures were marked `crc_valid=0`. It now matches the firmware and covers bytes [0..].

### Fixed

- **Wake-up burst truncated to ~60ms on the second and later reads** ([#127](https://github.com/genestealer/everblu-meters-esp8266-improved/issues/127)): `receive_radian_frame()` switches `MDMCFG4` to the 4x-oversampled 9.6 kbps RX rate, but `get_meter_data_for_meter()` never restored the 2.4 kbps TX rate before transmitting. Only the first read after boot worked (fresh from `cc1101_init()`); every later read clocked the wake-up burst out 4x too fast, draining the TX FIFO and hitting `TXFIFO_UNDERFLOW` (MARCSTATE 0x16) after ~60ms instead of the full ~2s burst. The TX phase now rewrites `MDMCFG4`/`MDMCFG3` to 2.4 kbps on every read.

```

### Added

- **`Reset Frequency Offset` MQTT button**: the standalone MQTT build now exposes the same frequency-offset reset action as the ESPHome component, with a Home Assistant button and MQTT topic that clears the stored offset and re-tunes the radio.
- **Reading plausibility guard (history cross-check)**: a reading is now rejected when its implied current-month usage (current volume minus the newest history snapshot) exceeds 100× the largest historical monthly usage. Skipped when history is insufficient (fewer than 2 valid months, flat history, or a volume predating the newest snapshot). Both builds (shared `radian_parser`).
- **Codecov code coverage reporting**: a dedicated `coverage.yml` GitHub Actions workflow runs the native PlatformIO test suite with gcov instrumentation (`--coverage`) and uploads results to Codecov via `gcovr`. Coverage is tracked for the three platform-neutral core files exercised by the native tests — `crc_kermit.cpp`, `radian_parser.cpp`, and `radian_decoder.cpp`. A Codecov badge has been added to the README.
- **Expanded native test coverage** ([#125](https://github.com/genestealer/everblu-meters-esp8266-improved/pull/125)): added edge-case unit tests for `radian_decode_4bitpbit()` (glitch recovery, buffer truncation, framing-error handling), `radian_validate_crc()`, and `radian_parse_primary_data()`, raising patch/project coverage of the shared core.
- **Timestamps in MQTT serial log output**: all tagged `[TAG] message` log lines in the standalone (MQTT) firmware now carry a `[HH:MM:SS]` UTC timestamp prefix matching the ESPHome log format. Timestamps are emitted from the moment the firmware starts (showing `[00:00:00]` until NTP syncs, then real UTC wall-clock time). Affects `[STATUS]`, `[MQTT]`, `[TIME]`, `[FREQ]`, `[WIFI]`, `[OTA]`, `[HISTORY]`, `[ERROR]`, `[WARN]`, `[SCHEDULE]`, and all other tagged lines. Plain banner/separator lines (`===...`, `METER READ - START`, etc.) are intentionally left without timestamps.
- **`tuned_frequency` and `frequency_estimate` MQTT sensors**: the standalone (MQTT) build now publishes Home Assistant discovery messages for `Tuned Frequency (MHz)` (unit `MHz`, topic `tuned_frequency`) and `Frequency Estimate` (unit `kHz`, topic `frequency_estimate`), matching the equivalent sensors already present in the ESPHome component.
- **`AUTO_SCAN_ON_FAILURE_ENABLED`** (both builds, opt-in, default `0`): when `MAX_RETRIES` is reached and the firmware enters cooldown, optionally run a narrow ±20 kHz / 1 kHz Deep scan once per failure streak to recalibrate the carrier-frequency offset. Set `#define AUTO_SCAN_ON_FAILURE_ENABLED 1` in `private.h` or `auto_scan_on_failure: true` in ESPHome YAML to enable. Disabled by default to avoid unexpected Wi-Fi/MQTT disruption during the scan (scans block 1–2 minutes).
- **Near-field RF saturation detection**: when a data frame is received but fails CRC and the RSSI is very strong (> −50 dBm), the firmware now logs an explicit `*** NEAR-FIELD SATURATION DETECTED ***` warning explaining that the device is **too close** to the meter (front-end overload), rather than the generic weak-signal message. Both README troubleshooting sections document the symptom and the fix (move 1–2 m away).
- **`scripts/capture-mqtt-log.ps1`**: convenience script that builds, uploads, and captures a timestamped serial monitor log to `temp/mqtt_<date>.log`.
- **`docs/FREQUENCY_CALIBRATION_SYSTEM.md`**: design reference covering the CC1101 bandwidth/FOC register changes, two-phase scan algorithm, FREQEST adaptive tracking loop, CC1101 hardware frequency-resolution boundary, and Fast-scan removal rationale.
- **RADIAN frame decoder developer tool** ([#119](https://github.com/genestealer/everblu-meters-esp8266-improved/pull/119)): added a local/offline decoder utility at `tools/hex_decoder.cpp` (with helper scripts) for protocol analysis and fixture/debug workflows.
- **ESPHome config validation - ESP32 Arduino framework required**: the `everblu_meter` component now fails fast during `esphome config` with a clear message ("requires ESP32 Arduino framework") when an ESP32 target is not using `framework: type: arduino`, instead of failing later in the C++ build with `fatal error: Arduino.h`. ESP8266 is unaffected.
- **ESPHome config validation - GDO0/GDO2 pin conflict**: configuration is now rejected at validation time when `gdo0_pin` and `gdo2_pin` resolve to the same GPIO (the two CC1101 status outputs must be on different pins).
- **ESPHome config validator test coverage**: added negative `esphome config` fixtures (`.ci/esphome/everblu_meter/test.invalid-*.yaml`) and Python unit tests (`tests/esphome/test_validators.py`, 27 cases) exercising the meter-code, GDO2-required, framework, pin-conflict, and reading-schedule validators. Wired into the ESPHome CI workflow as new `negative-validation` (asserts invalid configs are rejected with the expected error) and `python-unit-tests` jobs.
- **`esphome-release-sync` pre-commit hook**: a new local hook (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`) re-runs `ESPHOME/prepare-component-release.sh` whenever files under `src/`, `ESPHOME/components/everblu_meter/`, or the release script itself change. This keeps the generated `ESPHOME-release/` tree in sync when pre-commit.ci autofixes (`ruff`, `clang-format`) rewrite source files — pre-commit.ci now regenerates and commits the release output automatically, so the "ESPHOME Sync Check" job no longer fails on autofix commits. Uncovered and fixed a pre-existing formatting drift in `ESPHOME-release/everblu_meter/__init__.py` (a missing blank line vs. its source).

### Changed

- **MQTT auto-scan recovery now retries once immediately after a successful re-tune**: when `AUTO_SCAN_ON_FAILURE_ENABLED` finds and stores a new frequency offset after max retries, the standalone build performs one final read attempt before entering the 1-hour cooldown. The extra attempt runs at most once per failure streak and only when the scan changed the offset.
- **Deduplicated the RADIAN 4-bit-per-bit decoder** ([#118](https://github.com/genestealer/everblu-meters-esp8266-improved/issues/118)): `decode_4bitpbit_serial()` in `cc1101.cpp` now delegates to the shared, platform-neutral `radian_decode_4bitpbit()` (single source of truth for firmware and the native `hex_decoder` tool). Added native round-trip test coverage. No behavioural change.
- **CC1101 AGC profile rebalanced** ([#109](https://github.com/genestealer/everblu-meters-esp8266-improved/issues/109)): `AGCCTRL2` changed from `0xC7` (42 dB magnitude target, 3 DVGA steps disabled) to `0x43` (33 dB target, 1 DVGA step disabled). The 9 dB lower target gives the AGC loop headroom to reduce gain for strong near-field signals without degrading sensitivity for weak/distant meters. Affects both the MQTT standalone and ESPHome builds (shared driver `src/core/cc1101.cpp`).
- **`RX_ATTENUATION_DB` option added** (MQTT standalone, `include/private.h`): limits the CC1101 LNA gain for permanently close-mounted installations. Values `0` (default) / `6` / `12` / `18` dB. See `include/private.example.h` for usage.
- **`rx_attenuation` option added** (ESPHome, `everblu_meter:` YAML key): equivalent to `RX_ATTENUATION_DB` for the ESPHome build. Values `0` (default) / `6` / `12` / `18`.
- **`AUTO_SCAN_ENABLED` / `auto_scan` default changed to `false`** (both builds): the startup Deep frequency scan no longer runs automatically on first boot. The CC1101 RX bandwidth was widened to 270 kHz (±67.7 kHz automatic carrier-offset compensation) in this release, which means most installations lock onto the meter at the nominal 433.82 MHz without any scan. Enabling the scan unconditionally caused a 6-minute Wi-Fi/MQTT blackout on every new device without benefit. Set `#define AUTO_SCAN_ENABLED 1` (`private.h`) or `auto_scan: true` (ESPHome YAML) to restore the previous behaviour. The scan remains available at any time via the "Deep Frequency Scan" button.
- **CC1101 RX bandwidth widened 58 kHz → 270 kHz and FOC_LIMIT raised to ±BW/4** (`MDMCFG4 0xF6 → 0x66`, `FOCCFG 0x1D → 0x1E`) in the shared radio driver — affects **both** the MQTT and ESPHome builds. This is the most significant change in this release. The narrow 58 kHz filter with ±7.25 kHz automatic frequency-offset compensation could not tolerate a CC1101 reference-crystal error of more than a few ppm, which is why software frequency scanning was previously needed just to hear the meter. The 270 kHz filter gives the chip **±67.7 kHz of automatic carrier-offset correction (~±156 ppm at 433 MHz)**, so the radio now locks onto the meter at the nominal 433.82 MHz even with a badly off-spec crystal — usually with **no scan required at all**. The RADIAN signal is only ~15 kHz wide, so the extra bandwidth costs ~6.7 dB of noise floor, negligible against the typical >20 dB link margin. Frequency scanning remains available as a fallback for extreme drift or weak signals. See `docs/FREQUENCY_CALIBRATION_SYSTEM.md` for the full derivation.
- **Deep frequency scan algorithm overhauled** (both builds) — two phases replace the previous single-pass sweep:
  - **Phase 1 — window mapping**: scans the configured range in coarse steps, continuing past the first successful decode (`reads_counter > 0`) until `MISS_TOLERANCE` (5) consecutive misses, recording `firstHitFreq` and `lastHitFreq`. Exits as soon as the window closes — no longer scans to the end of range unnecessarily.
  - **Phase 2 — zoom**: always runs. Re-scans `firstHitFreq − step` to `lastHitFreq + step` with 4× finer steps to locate the exact carrier centre. Falls back to the window midpoint if all zoom steps miss (FREQEST adaptive tracking refines further on the next successful read). Single-point windows still trigger the zoom — the coarse hit may be at the band edge.
  - **Zoom step clamped to the CC1101 hardware minimum** (`Fxosc / 2^16 = 26 MHz / 65536 ≈ 397 Hz`). Steps finer than this silently round to the same register value, retesting the same physical frequency; the zoom step is now `max(scanStep × 0.25, 397 Hz)`.
  - `performDeepFrequencyScan()` is now parameterised with optional `scanRangeMHz` (default `0.150`) and `scanStepMHz` (default `0.0025`); existing callers are unaffected by the defaults. The auto-scan-on-failure path uses a narrow `±20 kHz / 1 kHz` call (~41 steps, ~30 s); the manual Deep Scan command and startup scan retain the full `±150 kHz` range.
- **Standalone (MQTT) build now shares the `FrequencyManager` implementation with ESPHome** instead of carrying its own duplicate ([#110](https://github.com/genestealer/everblu-meters-esp8266-improved/issues/110)). `src/main.cpp` previously reimplemented the Deep scan, adaptive FREQEST tracking, and EEPROM/Preferences offset storage (plus a duplicate `FEED_WDT()` watchdog helper) — so every frequency-calibration fix (including the #104 quality guard) had to be written twice. `main.cpp` now registers its `cc1101_init` / `get_meter_data` callbacks with `FrequencyManager` (`src/services/frequency_manager.cpp`) and delegates scanning, adaptive tracking, and persistence to it, keeping only thin MQTT glue (status/offset topic publishing) local. The scan/adaptive/storage logic is now single-sourced across both targets. The ESP8266 EEPROM layout is unchanged (magic `0xABCD` at address 0), so stored calibrations survive the upgrade; on ESP32 the shared store additionally writes a `freq_offset_magic` key, so an offset saved by a pre-refactor ESP32 build is treated as absent once (triggering a one-time re-scan if auto-scan is enabled). Minor behavioural note: remote WiFi-serial log lines are no longer drained per scan step (they arrive after the scan completes) since that MQTT-build-specific pump does not exist in the shared scanner.
- **Deep scan now ranks by decode quality and will not regress a good calibration** (both builds, [#104](https://github.com/genestealer/everblu-meters-esp8266-improved/issues/104)). Previously the scan persisted its chosen frequency unconditionally, ranking candidates by RSSI / first successful decode — so a strong-RSSI frequency tens of kHz off the true carrier (still decoding but with corrupted, CRC-failing bits) could overwrite a well-centred stored offset and degrade subsequent reads. The scan now: (1) performs a **post-lock verification read** at the chosen candidate frequency, measuring demodulation quality via `|FREQEST|` (smallest = best-centred on the carrier); and (2) when a known-good offset is already stored, **only overwrites it if the candidate is strictly better** — it verifies the existing offset too and keeps it unless the candidate decodes with a smaller `|FREQEST|` (or the stored offset no longer decodes at all). A candidate that fails post-lock verification never replaces a working stored offset. First-time calibration (no stored offset) still persists the scan result as before.
- **Deep Scan renamed** from "Scan Frequency" / MQTT topic `freq_scan` to "Deep Frequency Scan" / MQTT topic `deep_scan`. The Home Assistant button name and icon (`mdi:radar`) updated to match.
- **Read retry interval** reduced from 10 seconds to 5 seconds between successive attempts after a failed read.
- **History payload shaping for monthly usage** ([#124](https://github.com/genestealer/everblu-meters-esp8266-improved/pull/124)): `monthly_usage` now omits the oldest history month (which has no previous month for delta computation), and the JSON-building path was consolidated to keep history payload generation consistent.
- **Example YAML board configuration**: all five example YAMLs now include both an ESP8266 and ESP32 board configuration block; the inactive one is commented out with a clear `==========` section header so users can switch boards by toggling comments. All ESP32 blocks explicitly set `framework: type: arduino` (required since ESPHome 2026.1.0, whose default ESP32 framework is ESP-IDF — the `everblu_meter` component depends on Arduino headers and fails to compile under ESP-IDF).
- **Example YAML SPI pin guidance**: each example now carries a comment on the `spi:` block noting the alternative board's CLK/MOSI/MISO pins (e.g. ESP8266 `GPIO14/13/12` ↔ ESP32 `GPIO18/23/19`).
- **ESP32 CS pin changed from GPIO5 to GPIO25** in `example-advanced.yaml` and `example-gas-meter-minimal.yaml`: GPIO5 is an ESP32 strapping pin that causes boot warnings; GPIO25 is non-strapping, non-SPI, and output-capable. The `example-gas-meter-minimal.yaml` SPI pins and GDO2 pin were also corrected to their ESP32 equivalents (`GPIO18/23/19` and `GPIO27`), which had been left at ESP8266 values.
- **Pin references standardised to `GPIO` prefix** throughout all example YAMLs: bare integer values (e.g. `gdo0_pin: 4`) have been replaced with the `GPIO` prefix form (`gdo0_pin: GPIO4`) for consistency.
- **`reading_schedule` is now validated at config time and case-insensitive** (ESPHome): the option previously accepted any string and silently fell back to `Monday-Friday` at runtime when unrecognised. It is now validated against the known presets/weekdays (matching the C++ `ScheduleManager::isValidSchedule`) and accepts any letter case, normalising e.g. `monday-friday` -> `Monday-Friday` and `FRIDAY` -> `Friday`. An unknown value now fails `esphome config` with the list of valid options.

### Fixed

- **LQI value and percentage corrected** (both builds). The CC1101 LQI register packs `CRC_OK` in bit 7, so a good frame reported an LQI inflated by 128 (e.g. `243` instead of `115`); the stored value now masks bit 7 (`& 0x7F`). LQI is also a demodulation-*error* metric where a lower value is a better link, so `calculateLQIToPercentage()` now uses the 7-bit range and inverts the mapping (LQI `0` → `100%`). The ESPHome build's separate `ESPHomeDataPublisher::calculateLqiPercentage()` was aligned to match, so both builds now agree.
- **Missing newlines in two CC1101 debug log lines** (`src/core/cc1101.cpp`) caused adjacent log messages to run together; the `rssi/lqi/F_est` and `tmo/free_byte/sts` lines now terminate with `\n`.
- **`F_est` printed as unsigned in CC1101 debug output** (`src/core/cc1101.cpp`): the signed `FREQEST` register logged e.g. `F_est=255` instead of `-1`; now printed signed.
- **Stray `)` in the MQTT connection log line** (`src/main.cpp`): `[MQTT] Connected to MQTT Broker)` → `[MQTT] Connected to MQTT Broker`.
- **ESPHome build fix**: `TS_PRINTLN` / `TS_PRINTF` were defined only in the MQTT branch of `logging.h`, so shared files using them failed to compile for ESPHome. The ESPHome branch now also defines them (routed through `ESP_LOGI`).
- **Radio-state hang in `cc1101_rec_mode()`**: the wait loop that spins until the CC1101 reports an RX MARCSTATE (`0x0D`/`0x0E`/`0x0F`) had no timeout. If the radio wedged in a stuck state (e.g. `0x11` RXFIFO_OVERFLOW) it would spin forever while feeding the watchdog — hanging the whole firmware with the activity LED on and no reboot or further logs. The loop is now bounded: on timeout it flushes the RX FIFO (`SFRX`) and re-strobes RX once to recover, and if that still fails it returns so the caller's GDO0 wait times out gracefully.
- **`frequency_estimate` was incorrectly published to `frequency_offset`** in the MQTT `publishMeterReading()` path. The raw CC1101 `FREQEST` register value (the chip's live carrier-offset measurement) is now routed to the correct `frequency_estimate` topic (converted to kHz) and no longer overwrites the persisted offset value published by `publishFrequencyOffset()`.
- **`tuned_frequency` and `frequency_estimate` MQTT sensors blank in Home Assistant** (standalone build). Discovery messages were published but state topics were never written. `adaptiveFrequencyTracking()` now publishes both after every read; `tuned_frequency` is also seeded at boot from the stored calibration.
- **`AUTO_SCAN_ON_FAILURE_ENABLED` C++ default was `true` instead of `false`** (`src/adapters/implementations/define_config_provider.h`): when the macro was not defined in `private.h`, `isAutoScanOnFailureEnabled()` returned `true`, silently enabling failure-recovery scans even though `private.example.h` documented the default as `0` (disabled). The default is now `false` to match the documented behaviour; users who rely on this feature must explicitly set `#define AUTO_SCAN_ON_FAILURE_ENABLED 1`.
- **Boot-uptime timestamp showed `[boot+0s]` instead of elapsed seconds** (`src/core/logging.h`): `everblu_log_timestamp()` used `time()` for the pre-NTP-sync branch, which returns 0 (Unix epoch) on ESP8266 before the clock is set, so the label was always `[boot+0s]`. It now uses `millis()/1000` (actual seconds since reset). The static buffer was also enlarged from 16 to 20 bytes to prevent truncation.
- **Deep scan quality guard treated a valid 0.0 kHz calibration as "no prior calibration"** (`src/services/frequency_manager.cpp`): the guard used `previousOffset == 0.0f` to decide whether to skip the quality comparison and accept the scan result unconditionally. A device whose crystal is perfectly on-spec (offset genuinely 0.0 kHz) would have matched this check and bypassed the protection. A dedicated `s_hasStoredCalibration` flag (set by `begin()` when the NaN sentinel is not returned, and by `saveFrequencyOffset()` on every successful save) is now used instead, correctly distinguishing "no value ever saved" from "stored value happens to be 0.0".
- **Serial history table month labels were off by one** (`src/services/meter_history.cpp`): `printToSerial()` labelled the oldest history entry as `-13` when `monthCount=13`. The formula `monthCount − i` was incorrect; it now uses `monthCount − 1 − i`, matching the `getMonthLabel()` helper and making the oldest entry correctly display as `-12`.

### Removed

- **`MQTTDataPublisher` class** (`src/adapters/implementations/mqtt_data_publisher.{cpp,h}`). The standalone build publishes via `main.cpp` directly and never used this adapter; only the ESPHome build uses `IDataPublisher`. Removed to eliminate dead code.
- **Fast frequency scan** (both builds). It was redundant — the two-phase Deep scan does a coarse window-mapping pass followed by a fine zoom, making the old coarse-only Fast scan unnecessary. Removed: `performFastFrequencyScan()`, the `fast_scan` MQTT command and Home Assistant button, and the ESPHome `fast_scan_button` config option. Use the Deep scan (`deep_scan` MQTT topic / `deep_scan_button`) instead.

```

Non-breaking hardening follow-up to the v3.0.0 GDO2 changes. The default and both opt-out paths are unchanged; correctly-wired setups behave identically to v3.0.0.

### Fixed

- **TX FIFO overflow guard (GDO2 path).** The wake-up FIFO feed loop in `get_meter_data_for_meter()` now verifies real TX free space via `TXBYTES` before writing in GDO2 mode, matching the safety the SPI-polling fallback already had. A miswired / stuck-LOW GDO2 can no longer drive the 64-byte TX FIFO into overflow.

### Added

- **Stuck-GDO2 diagnostics.** When the TX interrogation-frame gate waits the full safety window with GDO2 still HIGH, the driver now logs an explicit "GDO2 still HIGH - check wiring" warning and increments a lifetime counter (`cc1101_get_gdo2_timeout_count()`), so a wiring fault is no longer silently misread as "meter asleep / out of range".
- **Boot-time GDO2 wiring self-test.** `cc1101_init()` performs a one-time check that GDO2 reads LOW with an empty TX FIFO and HIGH once the FIFO is filled past the threshold. A failed toggle logs a warning and bumps the same diagnostic counter, so a miswired GDO2 is flagged at boot instead of only after the first failed read.
- **ESPHome `gdo2_timeouts` diagnostic sensor** (optional) exposing that counter to Home Assistant.

### Changed

- **GDO2 input now uses a pull-up** (matching GDO0), so a disconnected/miswired GDO2 reads HIGH and fails loudly via the stuck-HIGH path instead of floating. ESP8266 has internal pull-ups on every GPIO except GPIO16.
- **ESPHome config validation** now rejects setting both `gdo2_pin:` and `disable_gdo2_fifo_management: true` (previously the opt-out was silently ignored when a pin was also present).

> **⚠️ BREAKING CHANGE** - CC1101 GDO2 hardware-assisted FIFO threshold management is now the **default** mechanism for talking to the radio on **both** the standalone (MQTT) and ESPHome targets. You must wire CC1101 GDO2 to a free GPIO and configure it, **or** explicitly opt out. Existing setups that did not wire GDO2 require migration (see below).
>
> This release also rolls in the previously unreleased v2.4.0 work: the hardware-assisted GDO2 FIFO mechanism (TX + RX) plus reliability, diagnostics, and data-validation improvements. Preserves ESP8266 (Arduino) and ESP32 + ESPHome support.

### Breaking Changes

- **GDO2 is required by default.** The GDO2 hardware FIFO mechanism is now enabled by default instead of being optional:
  - **MQTT / standalone firmware**: `include/private.h` must define either `GDO2 <pin>` (to enable, recommended) or `DISABLE_GDO2_FIFO_MANAGEMENT` (to opt out and keep legacy SPI polling). If neither is defined, the build fails with a clear compile-time `#error` from `src/core/cc1101.cpp` pointing to the README and `docs/GDO2_FIFO_MANAGEMENT.md`.
  - **ESPHome component**: `gdo2_pin:` is now required unless `disable_gdo2_fifo_management: true` is set. If neither is provided, configuration validation fails with a descriptive `cv.Invalid` error explaining both options and linking to the docs.

### Migration Required

- **If you want the new (recommended) behaviour**: wire CC1101 GDO2 to a free GPIO that does not collide with the SPI bus or GDO0, then:
  - MQTT: add `#define GDO2 <pin>` to `include/private.h` (e.g. `#define GDO2 4`).
  - ESPHome: add `gdo2_pin: <GPIO>` to your `everblu_meter:` block (e.g. `GPIO4` on ESP8266, `GPIO27` on ESP32).
- **If you cannot/do not want to wire GDO2**: opt out explicitly to keep the prior SPI-polling behaviour:
  - MQTT: add `#define DISABLE_GDO2_FIFO_MANAGEMENT` to `include/private.h`.
  - ESPHome: add `disable_gdo2_fifo_management: true` to your `everblu_meter:` block.

### Added

- **Hardware-assisted GDO2 FIFO threshold management** (Issues [#83](https://github.com/genestealer/everblu-meters-esp8266-improved/issues/83), [#84](https://github.com/genestealer/everblu-meters-esp8266-improved/issues/84)): the CC1101 driver uses the GDO2 pin as a hardware FIFO threshold signal on both standalone (MQTT) and ESPHome targets, dynamically reconfiguring `IOCFG2` per phase:
  - **TX phase** (`IOCFG2 = 0x02`): GDO2 asserts at the TX FIFO threshold and replaces the stale SPI `TXBYTES` status check and fixed `delay()` in the WUP feeding loop and interrogation-frame gate, proactively preventing `TXFIFO_UNDERFLOW` under ESPHome scheduler load.
  - **RX phase** (`IOCFG2 = 0x01`): GDO2 signals the RX FIFO threshold / end-of-packet, letting the RX drain loop skip unnecessary `RXBYTES` SPI reads while still draining promptly.
- `gdo2_pin` configuration in the ESPHome Python schema (`__init__.py`) and C++ integration, plus the standalone `GDO2` macro; new `cc1101_set_gdo2_pin()` API and `GET_GDO2_PIN()` accessor so both targets share the same logic.
- `disable_gdo2_fifo_management` ESPHome option and `DISABLE_GDO2_FIFO_MANAGEMENT` standalone macro to explicitly opt out of the GDO2 mechanism.
- **Single-day reading schedules**: the reading schedule now accepts a single weekday (e.g. `Monday`) in addition to the `Monday-Friday` / `Monday-Saturday` / `Monday-Sunday` presets, so meters can be read on just one day of the week. (Thanks [@b4dpxl](https://github.com/b4dpxl), [#79](https://github.com/genestealer/everblu-meters-esp8266-improved/pull/79).)
- **ANSI colour support for the standalone Serial / WiFi serial monitor**: log lines are colourised by level (`LOG_*`) and by leading subsystem tag (e.g. `[METER]`, `[FREQ]`) for easier scanning in the VS Code terminal, PlatformIO monitor, or telnet. ESPHome's own logger is unaffected. Disable at build time with `-D EVERBLU_LOG_COLOR=0`. `platformio.ini` now sets `monitor_filters = direct` so the escape sequences render instead of being rewritten to glyphs.
- **Wide frequency scan button for ESPHome radio crystal calibration** ([#96](https://github.com/genestealer/everblu-meters-esp8266-improved/pull/96)): a dedicated `wide_frequency_scan_button` runs the wide-band (±100 kHz) coarse + fine sweep (`performFrequencyScan(true)`). Previously ESPHome only exposed the narrow ±30 kHz refine scan, so a CC1101 whose crystal was off by more than 30 kHz could never lock onto the signal, never saved an offset, and appeared broken/per-meter. Wired through `EverbluMeterTriggerButton` codegen and added to all example YAMLs. The standalone (MQTT) build already performs a first-boot wide scan and is unchanged.
- **Robust ESPHome deploy script** (`scripts/deploy-esphome-to-ha.ps1`, [#97](https://github.com/genestealer/everblu-meters-esp8266-improved/pull/97)): a runnable replacement for the ad-hoc `Remove-Item`/`Copy-Item` deploy notes that clears read-only attributes and uses `robocopy /MIR`, so a partial/aborted copy can no longer leave a broken component on the Home Assistant share.
- Native unit tests covering RADIAN volume and out-of-range time rejection, plus expanded `schedule_manager` schedule-matching tests.
- **Developer tooling**: repo-wide linting/formatting via `.clang-format` (ESPHome code style) for C++, `ruff.toml` for Python, and `.yamllint` for YAML; `ESPHOME/format-component.ps1`/`.sh` helper scripts; an expanded pre-commit configuration; and comprehensive ESPHome CI fixtures (`.ci/esphome/*`) exercising all sensors, options, and code paths (including a legacy GDO2 opt-out config).

### Changed

- **Default maximum read retries lowered from 10 to 5** on both the standalone (MQTT) and ESPHome targets ([#98](https://github.com/genestealer/everblu-meters-esp8266-improved/pull/98)). The count remains user-configurable via `MAX_RETRIES` (`include/private.h`) and `max_retries` (ESPHome, range 1–50); examples, docs, and `ESPHOME-release/` were updated accordingly.
- **Frequency calibration sensors are now global (per-radio)** ([#96](https://github.com/genestealer/everblu-meters-esp8266-improved/pull/96)): `frequency_offset`, `tuned_frequency`, and `frequency_estimate` use static pointers (first-registration wins), so the single radio-wide offset is reflected in one set of Home Assistant entities instead of being duplicated per meter. The frequency offset is a property of the **radio**, so all meters on one CC1101 share the same base frequency.
- **Device-level sensors are now shared across meters** ([#96](https://github.com/genestealer/everblu-meters-esp8266-improved/pull/96)): `CC1101 Connected`, `CC1101 State`, and `Firmware Version` describe the single shared radio/firmware, so their sensor pointers are now static (first-registration wins) and are declared once in the multi-meter example instead of being duplicated per meter.
- **Suppressed verbose per-attempt logging during frequency scans** ([#97](https://github.com/genestealer/everblu-meters-esp8266-improved/pull/97)): frequency scans invoke a full meter-read sequence at every step, which flooded the log with irrelevant `[METER]`/`[CC1101]`/`[RX]` detail. A `g_echo_debug_quiet` flag honoured by `echo_debug()`, plus a non-copyable/non-movable `EchoDebugQuietGuard` RAII helper, wraps the wide/narrow scan functions on both the ESPHome and standalone builds; high-level scan progress (`LOG_*`) remains visible.
- **`ESPHOME/prepare-component-release.ps1` now retries lock-prone file operations** ([#96](https://github.com/genestealer/everblu-meters-esp8266-improved/pull/96)): OneDrive/antivirus can briefly hold handles on `ESPHOME-release/` files; the clear, copy, flatten, include-rewrite, and LF-normalize steps are now wrapped in an `Invoke-WithRetry` helper that waits with an increasing delay before giving up, so the release script and pre-commit hook no longer fail mid-run.
- `FIFOTHR` changed from `0x47` (TX threshold 33 bytes) to `0x49` (TX threshold 25 bytes), guaranteeing ≥ 40 free bytes so the 8-byte WUP buffer and 39-byte interrogation frame can be written after a single GDO2 check. Applied regardless of GDO2 wiring.
- **Non-blocking WiFi serial monitor**: all TCP output now flows through a power-of-two ring buffer drained in `loop()`, so a slow or full TCP socket can no longer stall the main loop. Dropped-byte counts are reported to the client on overrun, the buffer is reset on each new client connection, and the welcome banner now includes the ESP8266 reset reason.
- `include/private.example.h` now enables `#define GDO2 4` by default and documents the `DISABLE_GDO2_FIFO_MANAGEMENT` opt-out.
- All ESPHome examples (`example-water-meter.yaml`, `example-gas-meter-minimal.yaml`, `example-advanced.yaml`, `example-nano-esp32.yaml`, `example-multi-meter.yaml`) now set `gdo2_pin` by default with safe free-GPIO choices and opt-out notes, and include SPI-bus pin warnings (avoiding GPIO12/13/14 on ESP8266).
- **Configuration logging**: the ESPHome `dump_config` and the standalone startup banner report whether GDO0/GDO2 are configured and how FIFO threshold detection is performed. `dump_config` reports the GDO2 fallback state as "disabled (legacy SPI polling fallback)" and the standalone banner reports whether GDO2 is enabled, explicitly disabled via `DISABLE_GDO2_FIFO_MANAGEMENT`, or misconfigured.
- **Meter-read logging clarity** (standalone): each read is now wrapped in `METER READ - START / COMPLETE / FAILED` banner blocks, with the firmware version folded into the START banner (removing the duplicate `[STATUS] Firmware version` line). A successful TX FIFO drain (`MARCSTATE 0x16`) is reported neutrally as the normal end of transmit instead of a false "No response" failure, and the "meter asleep / out of range / wrong Year-Serial" guidance is deferred until both the ACK and data-frame stages actually fail. CRC-failure and frame-timeout messages were reworded to point at RF link quality (antenna/frequency) rather than a code fault, the "First 32 bytes" hex dump is kept on a single line, and a malformed UTC seconds separator (`%02d:%02d/%02d` rendering `16:09/17` instead of `16:09:17`) was corrected at all three time-print sites.
- **WiFi serial live streaming during frequency scans**: the standalone frequency-scan loops now drain the WiFi serial ring buffer between steps, so remote log output streams live during a scan instead of arriving all at once when it completes.
- **Repo-wide formatting/style pass**: C++, Python, and YAML sources reformatted to the new `.clang-format`/`ruff`/`yamllint` rules (accounts for the large mechanical churn in `everblu_meter.cpp`/`.h`, `__init__.py`, and others); no behavioural change.
- **CI workflows** reworked across all nine workflows: added `concurrency` with cancel-in-progress, `paths:` filters so jobs only run on relevant changes, a draft-PR skip guard, and manual `workflow_dispatch`, while retaining continuous per-push PR feedback and `develop` push builds ([#92](https://github.com/genestealer/everblu-meters-esp8266-improved/pull/92), [#94](https://github.com/genestealer/everblu-meters-esp8266-improved/pull/94)).
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`, README, and `ESPHOME/docs/*` updated, including ESPHome Device Builder compatibility notes and a fix for malformed Markdown list structure in the README configuration/advanced sections ([#87](https://github.com/genestealer/everblu-meters-esp8266-improved/pull/87)).
- README and `ESPHOME/README.md` updated: GDO2 documented as required-by-default with opt-out instructions, wiring tables marked accordingly, and ESPHome documentation links surfaced prominently near the top of the main README.
- Standardized file header comments across `src/core/` to the Doxygen `@file`/`@brief` style already used throughout `src/services/` and `src/adapters/`, resolving documentation drift from multiple contributors; added missing headers to `crc_kermit.h`/`.cpp`, `radian_parser.h`/`.cpp`, and `meter_code_parser.h`, and converted plain-comment headers in `cc1101.cpp`, `wifi_serial.h`/`.cpp`, and `version.h`.
- Added the `docs/GDO2_FIFO_MANAGEMENT.md` design document (TX and RX paths).
- Regenerated the `ESPHOME-release/` bundle so it reflects the new GDO2 support and standardized headers.
- Bumped firmware version to `3.0.0`.

### Fixed

- **Frequency offset now persists across power-cycle reboots on ESP8266** ([#96](https://github.com/genestealer/everblu-meters-esp8266-improved/pull/96)): ESPHome assigns preference storage slots by `make_preference()` call order and defaults to RTC memory (wiped on power loss). The previous code created a new preference object inside every `saveFloat`/`loadFloat`, so save and load landed on different slots - the post-save read-back passed but the value was never found again after a reboot. One `ESPPreferenceObject` per key hash is now cached and reused for save/load, with `in_flash=true` so the offset is written to the flash sector and survives a full power cycle. ESP32 (NVS) and the standalone EEPROM path are unaffected.
- **Restored frequency calibration is now confirmed at boot** ([#96](https://github.com/genestealer/everblu-meters-esp8266-improved/pull/96)): `begin()` distinguishes a genuinely persisted offset (even `0.0`) from "nothing stored" using a NaN sentinel, logs an explicit RESTORED-vs-not-found line, and publishes the restored offset and tuned frequency to Home Assistant at boot so persistence can be verified without waiting for the first read.
- **ESPHome `clearKey`/`hasKey` are now consistent and flash-safe** ([#96](https://github.com/genestealer/everblu-meters-esp8266-improved/pull/96)): `clearKey()` previously used a fresh `make_preference<float>(hash)` targeting a different slot/length than `saveFloat`/`loadFloat` and omitting `in_flash`, so it could not reliably invalidate the stored offset. It now reuses the cached flash-backed preference object and writes a zeroed magic so a later `loadFloat` fails its magic check and returns the default. Both `clearKey()` and `hasKey()` guard against a null `global_preferences`, treat a zeroed magic as absent, and sync the cleared slot to flash so the clear survives a reboot.
- **RX frame truncation when GDO2 is wired**: the Stage-2 payload receive loop runs in `PKTCTRL0_INFINITE_LENGTH` mode where the CC1101 never generates an end-of-packet, so GDO2 (`IOCFG2 = 0x01`) only asserted at the 40-byte RX FIFO threshold and the final sub-threshold remainder of each frame was skipped indefinitely. The Stage-2 loop now always polls `RXBYTES` to drain the tail (Stage-1 fixed-length sync loop and TX-side GDO2 logic are unchanged).
- RADIAN data validation now rejects physically impossible meter volumes (> 1 billion litres), guarding against corrupted decode alignment. (Out-of-range time-value rejection already shipped in v2.3.0.)
- `meter_reader` now maintains the active reading state throughout the retry sequence (the "Active Reading" sensor and radio state stay asserted across the whole retry sequence and are cleared only on final success or after max retries, instead of flickering idle between attempts).
- Refresh `MARCSTATE` on a GDO2 underflow break and guard the interrogation-frame write with a FIFO-ready check.
- **Junk sensor values before the first read** ([#69](https://github.com/genestealer/everblu-meters-esp8266-improved/issues/69)): the ESPHome component now publishes its known-at-boot configuration (meter year/serial, schedule, reading time, frequency, firmware version) and sensible idle placeholders (radio `Idle`, status `Ready`, error `None`, `active_reading` false) at the end of `setup()`, so display lambdas and other components no longer read uninitialised sensor state before Home Assistant connects. Numeric sensors with restored history are left untouched so HA-restored values are not overwritten.
- Guard against a null `gmtime()` result in the scheduled-read check and standalone time prints to avoid a potential null dereference.

  - "ESPHome multi-meter support and validation/schema hardening"
  - "Fixture-based native regression testing and CI automation for frame replay"
  - "Optional MQTT Home Assistant discovery publishing toggle"

metadata_status: derived_from_main_tag_range_and_pr_descriptions
```

> **⚠️ BREAKING CHANGE** - This release enforces strict validation of the meter code format. Existing configurations with flexible serial lengths (1–8 digits) **will not validate** without migration. See [Migration Required](#migration-required) below.

### Breaking Changes

- **Meter Code Validation**: The meter code format is now strictly enforced as `YY-SSSSSSS[-NNN]`:
  - `YY`: Exactly 2-digit year
  - `SSSSSSS`: Exactly 7-digit serial number (leading zeros allowed)
  - `NNN`: Optional 3-digit suffix (check digits, ignored if present)
- Serial numbers shorter or longer than 7 digits will now be rejected.
- Error messages updated to clarify "exactly 7 digits" instead of "1 to 8 digits".

### Migration Required

- Update your `METER_CODE` in `include/private.h` to match the strict format `YY-SSSSSSS[-NNN]`.
- Ensure all ESPHome YAML configurations use valid meter codes with exactly 7-digit serials.

### Changed

- Updated `src/core/meter_code_parser.h` to enforce strict 7-digit serial validation.
- Updated ESPHome validator to require `len(serial_str) == 7`.
- Updated error messages and examples to reflect the exact format.
- Updated test cases to validate only 7-digit serials.

### Fixed

- Added new test case to reject short serials (<7 digits).
- Removed outdated references to "1 to 8 digits" in comments and documentation.

### Added

- Added compile-time MQTT option `ENABLE_HA_DISCOVERY` (default `1`) to allow disabling Home Assistant discovery topic publishing (`homeassistant/...`) while keeping raw MQTT telemetry and command topics active (Issue #77).

### Changed

- Updated `include/private.example.h` and README configuration guidance with the new Home Assistant discovery toggle.
- Bumped firmware/component version to `2.2.1`.

scope_summary:
  - "ESPHome SPI bus integration with explicit spi_id/cs_pin schema (breaking config migration)"
  - "Broader ESPHome external-component CI matrix and local component build test tooling"
metadata_status: derived_from_main_tag_range_and_pr_descriptions
```

> **⚠️ BREAKING CHANGE** - This release contains a breaking ESPHome configuration schema change due to the explicit SPI integration. Existing `everblu_meter` YAML configurations **will not validate** without migration. See [Migration Required](#migration-required) below.

### Breaking Changes

- ESPHome component configuration schema changed.
- Existing ESPHome YAML that relied on implicit CC1101 SPI wiring will no longer validate.
- `everblu_meter` now requires explicit SPI integration fields:
  - top-level `spi:` bus definition
  - `spi_id` under `everblu_meter`
  - `cs_pin` under `everblu_meter`

### Migration Required

- Add a top-level `spi:` block with your board-specific CLK/MOSI/MISO pins.
- Add `spi_id` and `cs_pin` to `everblu_meter`.
- Keep `gdo0_pin` configured under `everblu_meter`.

### Changed

- Bumped firmware/component version to `2.2.0` to reflect the large ESPHome SPI integration and migration impact.
- Consolidated release notes for SPI schema migration, example updates, and ESPHome CC1101 integration hardening.
- Updated ESPHome example configurations to the new SPI schema (`spi:` bus + `spi_id` + `cs_pin`) across water, gas, advanced, and Nano ESP32 examples.
- Added SPI migration guidance in ESPHome README with explicit before/after configuration snippets.
- Clarified ESPHome CC1101 SPI transport behavior and comments to avoid implying the `500kHz` setup call controls ESPHome transfer speed.

### Fixed

- Reduced misleading `[ERROR] TX ABORTED due to TXFIFO_UNDERFLOW` and related `[ERROR]` log messages that appeared whenever a meter did not respond during polling. These are expected conditions (meter asleep, out of range, or wrong Year/Serial configured) and are no longer logged at error level. They now appear with `[METER]`/`[RX]` prefixes and include context explaining likely causes.
- Updated ESPHome `error_sensor` text (visible in Home Assistant) to display actionable messages such as `"No meter response (asleep/out of range/wrong Year/Serial) - retrying"` and `"No meter response after max retries - check distance and meter Year/Serial"` instead of generic failure strings.
- Prevented ESPHome boot state republish from overwriting CC1101 init failures with `status=Ready` and `error=None`.
- Removed unused `cs_pin` storage from ESPHome CC1101 SPI bridge (`cc1101_set_spi_device` now takes only the SPI device pointer).
- Removed unused `CONF_CS_PIN` import in ESPHome component schema module.
- Corrected Nano ESP32 example to include required SPI fields and removed unsupported `consecutive_failures` sensor.

## [v2.1.0] - 2026-01-19

### AI Metadata

```yaml
release_type: minor
base_branch: main
release_branch: historical
includes_prs: [45]
notable_superseded_work: []
scope_summary:
  - "ESPHome integration moved to production-ready status with hardware validation"
  - "Expanded sensor/control surface and adaptive frequency tracking rollout"
  - "Dual-mode packaging workflow for ESPHOME-release maintained from shared sources"
metadata_status: derived_from_main_tag_range_and_pr_descriptions
```

**🎉 ESPHome Integration is NOW FULLY WORKING! 🎉**

Major production release with fully functional ESPHome component integration.

### Added

- **ESPHome Integration**: Full production support with 15+ sensors, Home Assistant binary state gating, and button controls
- **Adaptive Frequency Tracking**: Intelligent frequency offset optimization based on successful reads with configurable thresholds
- **Enhanced Sensors**: Read attempts counter, frequency offset monitoring, tuned frequency reporting, and meter status indicators
- **Dual-Mode Release Package**: `ESPHOME-release/` directory for ESPHome distribution, dynamically built from shared source
- **Release Build Scripts**: Cross-platform PowerShell and bash scripts to prepare component distribution
- **Storage Persistence**: Frequency offset persistence with verification (note: offset discovery not persistent between ESPHome reboots)
- **Button Controls**: Manual read triggers, frequency offset reset, and radio reinitialization commands

### Changed

- Updated YAML configuration examples (advanced, minimal, water meter) with new sensors and features
- Enhanced data publishing in both ESPHome and MQTT adapters for new metrics
- Improved logging for frequency adjustments and read attempts
- IntelliSense optimization for ESPHome component development
- Documentation and repository URL updates for release clarity

### Fixed

- ESPHome radio initialization and sensor availability handling
- Log routing in ESPHome to capture all MeterReader logs in UI
- Repository URL references in documentation
- VSCode configuration for ESPHOME-release folder integration

### Known Issues

- CC1101 discovered best frequency not persistent between ESPHome reboots (frequency offset offset discovery mechanism needs refinement)
- All core functionality remains operational despite this limitation

### Testing

- ESPHome integration fully tested on hardware
- Standalone MQTT mode validated on ESP8266
- Dual-mode shared codebase verified with ~95% code reuse

### Dual-Mode Architecture

The `ESPHOME-release/` folder is **dynamically built** from shared source files via `prepare-component-release.ps1` (Windows) or `prepare-component-release.sh` (Unix):

1. **Single Source, Dual Distribution**: Core business logic in `src/` is shared between standalone MQTT and ESPHome modes
2. **Release Preparation**: Build scripts copy entire `src/` tree + ESPHome adapter layer into `ESPHOME-release/everblu_meter/`
3. **Include Path Preservation**: No file modifications-pure structural copy preserves all relative includes
4. **Component Integration**: ESPHome loads all `.cpp`/`.h` files directly from the release package
5. **Maintenance Simplification**: Bug fixes and features in `src/` automatically included in next component distribution

This approach eliminates code duplication while supporting both MQTT discovery and native ESPHome integration seamlessly.
