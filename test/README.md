# Unit Tests

Unit tests for the EverBlu Meters ESP8266/ESP32 project, using the Unity test
framework. Every suite runs on the host: no board, no radio, no meter needed.

## Suites

### `test_native_meter_fixtures/`

End-to-end replay of real radio captures.

- Raw oversampled CC1101 receive buffers from `test/fixtures/meter_frames/raw_frames.lst`
  are pushed through the RADIAN decoder, then the parser, then checked against
  the expected meter reading.
- Fully decoded 124-byte frames from `test/fixtures/meter_frames/fixtures.lst`
  are parsed and checked field by field.
- Also covers CRC validation, framing errors, glitch tolerance, buffer
  truncation, history bounds and read-failure classification.
- `test_transmit_frame.cpp` covers the other direction: the interrogation frame
  built by `Make_Radian_Master_req()` is pushed back through the receiver and
  checked to recover the original payload, identity and CRC.

To add a fixture from a firmware log:

```bash
python scripts/extract-meter-fixture.py --input meter-capture.log --append --name-prefix capture
```

### `test_embedded_unit/`

Pure logic tests for the platform-neutral parts of the firmware.

- `test_config_validation.cpp` - meter code parsing, schedule string validation
- `test_schedule_manager.cpp` - reading days, UTC/local conversion, clamping, auto-alignment to the meter wake window
- `test_utils.cpp` - CRC-16/KERMIT correctness, determinism and bit-flip detection
- `test_meter_history.cpp` - monthly usage maths, meter-reset handling, the history JSON payload
- `test_runner.cpp` - the single Unity entry point; every test case is registered here

### `test_native_meter_reader/`

Behaviour of the two stateful services, driven against fake hardware.

- `test_meter_reader.cpp` - retry sequence and backoff, post-failure cooldown,
  schedule gating and edge detection, failure classification, publish ordering,
  the manual stop path and the automatic scan after a failure streak
- `test_frequency_manager.cpp` - deep scan lock and abort paths, the calibration
  quality guard, persistence round-trips and adaptive FREQEST tracking

### `test_native_cc1101_link/`

The boot-time SPI link self-test in `cc1101_init()`.

This is the only suite that links the real `src/core/cc1101.cpp`. It runs under
`[env:native_cc1101]`, where `test/native_shims/SPI.h` stands in for the bus and
`native_cc1101_device.h` stands in for the radio, so the driver's own SPI
handling is exercised rather than replaced by `FakeRadio`.

Covers the healthy path, a MISO line stuck at any constant (including 0x0F and
0x14, values the old identity-only check would have accepted), an absent radio,
an unknown silicon revision, an unstable bus, and re-running the self-test on
the repeated `cc1101_init()` calls a frequency scan makes.

### `test_native_esphome_publisher/`

ESPHomeDataPublisher, built the way the shipped external component builds it.

Runs under `[env:native_esphome]` rather than `[env:native]`, because the whole
publisher is wrapped in `#ifdef USE_ESPHOME` and the ESPHome build needs a
flattened include path. The recording sensor stubs live in
`test/native_esphome/esphome/`, on that environment's include path only, so
`__has_include("esphome/core/log.h")` stays false for the MQTT-mode suites.

Covers sensor population and formatting, the history payload and its
"unavailable" fallbacks, null-argument handling, unit conversions, and the
"first non-null registration wins" rule for the sensors that describe the one
shared radio.

## Fakes and the virtual clock

`test/native_fakes.{h,cpp}` provides the test doubles. It sits in the test root
rather than in a suite folder because PlatformIO compiles everything listed in
`build_src_filter` into *every* host test binary, so all suites have to be able
to resolve the same symbols.

It replaces three things at link time:

| Replaced | Why |
| --- | --- |
| CC1101 free functions (`cc1101_init`, `get_meter_data_for_meter`, ...) | No radio on the host |
| `StorageAbstraction` | No EEPROM or NVS on the host |
| `WifiSerialStream` / `WiFiSerial` | No network stack; log output goes to stdout. Only compiled when `WIFI_SERIAL_MONITOR_ENABLED` is `1`, which `env:native` sets so the mirror path stays covered on the host |

The CC1101 replacement is skipped when `EVERBLU_NATIVE_REAL_CC1101` is defined,
which `[env:native_cc1101]` sets so the real driver can be linked instead.
That environment simulates the layer below the driver rather than the driver
itself: `test/native_shims/SPI.h` routes every transfer to a handler, and
`test/test_native_cc1101_link/native_cc1101_device.h` answers as a CC1101 whose
MISO line can be made to stick, float or misbehave on demand.

The fake radio answers in one of two modes. Scripted mode consumes a queue of
`tmeter_data` outcomes, repeating the last entry once the script runs out.
Frequency-selective mode places a simulated carrier at a chosen offset and only
answers while the radio is tuned inside the response window, reporting a FREQEST
proportional to the tuning error. That is what makes the deep frequency scan
testable in milliseconds instead of the minutes a real sweep takes.

The shim clock is virtual and starts at a fixed value. Tests move time with
`nativeClockAdvance(ms)`, and `delay()` advances it too, so retry delays and
cooldowns are exercised instantly and deterministically. Nothing ever sleeps.

## Running

```powershell
# One-off: install the tooling (platformio, pytest, esphome, gcovr)
pip install -r scripts/requirements-dev.txt

# Everything CI runs, in the same order
./scripts/run-tests.ps1            # host suites only (a few seconds)
./scripts/run-tests.ps1 -Build     # also compile both firmware targets
./scripts/run-tests.ps1 -All       # also collect coverage
./scripts/run-tests.ps1 -Serial    # show the firmware log output
```

Or drive PlatformIO directly:

```bash
# All MQTT-mode host suites
pio test -e native

# The ESPHome-mode suite
pio test -e native_esphome

# The CC1101 driver suite
pio test -e native_cc1101

# One suite
pio test -e native -f test_embedded_unit

# Verbose
pio test -e native -v
```

`pio test -e huzzah` (or any board environment) deliberately runs nothing:
`test_ignore` in `platformio.ini` excludes every suite, because none of them
needs hardware and all are already covered on the host in CI.

## Native Arduino shim

`test/native_shims/Arduino.h` is a small stand-in for the Arduino core, added to
the include path only by `[env:native]`. It supplies `millis()`, `delay()`,
`constrain()`, `map()`, the `Print`/`Stream` base classes and a `Serial` object,
so that shared service code such as `src/services/schedule_manager.cpp` compiles
on a desktop host.

Serial output from the firmware under test is discarded by default. Set
`EVERBLU_NATIVE_SERIAL=1` to mirror it to stdout when debugging a failure.

Keep the shim minimal. Extend it when a newly host-tested source needs a symbol,
rather than trying to emulate the whole Arduino API.

## Adding a test

1. Add the test function to the relevant `test_*.cpp` file, or create a new one
   in the same suite directory.
2. Declare it and register it with `RUN_TEST(...)` in that suite's runner
   (`test_runner.cpp` for `test_embedded_unit`, `test_native_meter_reader` and
   `test_native_esphome_publisher`, `main()` for `test_native_meter_fixtures`).
3. Do not define `setUp`, `tearDown` or `main` in the individual test files:
   Unity allows only one of each per suite binary.
4. If the code under test is not already compiled for the host, add its `.cpp`
   to `build_src_filter` under `[env:native]` in `platformio.ini`.

## Assertions

Commonly used Unity assertions:

- `TEST_ASSERT_TRUE(condition)`
- `TEST_ASSERT_FALSE(condition)`
- `TEST_ASSERT_EQUAL_INT(expected, actual)`
- `TEST_ASSERT_EQUAL_UINT32(expected, actual)`
- `TEST_ASSERT_EQUAL_HEX16(expected, actual)`
- `TEST_ASSERT_NOT_EQUAL(expected, actual)`
- `TEST_ASSERT_FLOAT_WITHIN(delta, expected, actual)`
- `TEST_ASSERT_NULL(pointer)` / `TEST_ASSERT_NOT_NULL(pointer)`

See the [Unity assertion reference](https://github.com/ThrowTheSwitch/Unity/blob/master/docs/UnityAssertionsReference.md)
for the full list.

## Coverage

CI collects coverage over the host-tested sources with gcovr. Locally:

```bash
pio test -e native
pio test -e native_esphome
gcovr --root . --object-directory .pio/build/ --print-summary \
  --filter src/core/crc_kermit.cpp \
  --filter src/core/radian_parser.cpp \
  --filter src/core/radian_decoder.cpp \
  --filter src/core/utils.cpp \
  --filter src/adapters/implementations/esphome_data_publisher.cpp \
  --filter src/services/frequency_manager.cpp \
  --filter src/services/meter_history.cpp \
  --filter src/services/meter_reader.cpp \
  --filter src/services/schedule_manager.cpp
```

## Full FDR verification

Run every native variant, including debug and legacy FIFO polling:

```sh
pio test -e native -e native_esphome -e native_cc1101 \
  -e native_cc1101_debug -e native_cc1101_legacy
pytest -q tests/esphome
esphome compile .ci/esphome/everblu_meter/test.esp8266-fdr.yaml
esphome compile ESPHOME/example-full-fdr-memory-probe.yaml
```

`tests/esphome/test_mqtt_full_fdr.py` compiles the actual standalone command body with a
recording MQTT/radio harness. It covers busy/pending work, capture and formatter
failures, allocation/publication failure, retained-publication intent and packet
restoration, formatter release before publication and delayed callbacks consumed
during scans. CI collects it with the existing ESPHome Python suite; it explicitly
skips when no C++ compiler is installed. It does not simulate a broker's QoS 0 delivery acknowledgement.
The publisher suites verify retention across failed refreshes and meter isolation.
The formatter suite asserts the maximum raw JSON size including timestamps.

`tests/esphome/test_fdr_delivery.py` validates the getter schema and the public
native-client signatures. It executes the guide client against a narrow fake of
public API methods: subscription alone, missing values and another meter's
state must not permit a fetch before initialisation. It covers cached/fresh
retrieval, the response flag, nested JSON and the before-capture error. Run it
with ESPHome 2026.1.0/current and aioesphomeapi 43.0.0/current. It does not claim
TCP transport or firmware initialisation integration coverage.

Source-dependent upstream investigations are opt-in, outside default CI:

```bash
pytest tools/fdr_delivery_source_probe.py -q
```

This probe imports upstream client implementation and compiles extracted web
routing methods; upstream internal changes can require updating it. Set
`FDR_HA_MANAGER_SOURCE` to an independently downloaded Home Assistant 2026.1.0
`homeassistant/components/esphome/manager.py` to include the HA source check.
Otherwise only that optional check skips. No proprietary source is needed.

The [hardware probe](../ESPHOME/example-full-fdr-memory-probe.yaml) requires only
an ESP8266 and network connection, no meter or radio. Its actual synthetic payload
lambda is also exercised on the host. Build size, host tests and ESP32 field tests
do not establish ESP8266 runtime heap feasibility; follow the
[measurement procedure](../docs/full-fdr.md#payload-memory-and-hardware-verification).
